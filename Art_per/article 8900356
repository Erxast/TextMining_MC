Abstract : In infants and children, cervical masses originate from a variety of pathologic, congenital and developmental conditions, and it is important to distinguish benign from serious lesions. Fibromatosis colli is a rare cervical lesion that typically presents in the neonatal period. It is the most common cause of neonatal torticollis and should be recognized by physicians caring for neonates and infants.
