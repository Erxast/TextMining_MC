Abstract : Fetal abnormalities including chylous ascites, polyhydramnios, claw hands, and hammer toes were identified in an infant who had a missense mutation R106P and a 52bp deletion in the gene for a peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme, D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, D-bifunctional protein. The patient had psychomotor retardation and craniofacial dysmorphism and died at 7 months of age. The patient had atypical fetal manifestations of this enzyme deficiency.
