Abstract : In the surgical management of congenital pes valgus, vertical talus is the hardiest deformity to be reduced. By opening the lower tibio-fibular joint, associated with classic capsulotomies and tendons-lengthening, the authors have reduced vertical talus easily in three feet, for two children. One of them had a myopathy (central core disease), the other had a muscular hypotonia by cerebral palsy. Morphological results are good, but the function remains fair, due to the muscular weakness, that is usual in these lesions.
