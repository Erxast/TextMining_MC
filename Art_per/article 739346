Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case of unilateral type I Duane's syndrome associated with muscular dystrophy is presented. The diagnosis of muscular dystrophy (Duchenne type) is firmly established by clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological, and histological observations. The ocular anomali is clearly distinguished from other congenital disorders of eye movements. The combination of these two congenital anomalities is considered to be quite rare.
