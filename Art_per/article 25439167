Abstract : This paper introduces a novel assessment tool to provide clinicians with quantitative and more objective measures of upper limb coordination in patients suffering from Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). The Virtual Peg Insertion Test (VPIT) involves manipulating an instrumented handle in order to move nine pegs into nine holes displayed in a virtual environment. The main outcome measures were the number of zero-crossings of the hand acceleration vector, as a measure of movement coordination and the total time required to complete the insertion of the nine pegs, as a measure of overall upper limb performance.8\9 patients with ARSACS were able to complete five repetitions with the VPIT. Patients were found to be significantly less coordinated and slower than age-matched healthy subjects (p<0.01). Performance of ARSACS patients was positively correlated with the Nine-Hole Peg Test (r=0.85, p<0.01) and with age (r=0.93, p<0.01), indicative of the degenerative nature of the disease.This study presents preliminary results on the use of a robotics and virtual reality assessment tool with ARSACS patients. Results highlight its potential to assess impaired coordination and monitor its progression over time.
