Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Authors report on the results of 51 quadriceps-plasties according to Bennett in the treatment of the extension contracture of the knee. The result was influenced among others by the number of the functioning muscle fibers, by the grade of the preoperative muscular contracture and the postoperative physiotherapy and by the physical and mental development of the patients. In nearly two thirds of the cases very good and good results were achieved. Special questions of the operative technique and the postoperative function are discussed.
