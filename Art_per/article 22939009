Abstract : Alloplastic total temporomandibular joint replacement (TJR) for end-stage disease, congenital disorders, and after ablative surgery has been shown improve function and to decrease pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pain pressure threshold (PPT) and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in patients undergoing alloplastic TJR.Subjects requiring TJR from May 2007 through February 2011 were enrolled in the study. The PPT and OHRQoL were measured preoperatively and 2, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The primary predictor variable was postoperative time (preoperatively and 2, 6, and 12 months postoperatively). The primary outcome variables were the PPT and OHRQoL.Seventeen subjects requiring TJR were enrolled in and completed the required 12-month follow-up. There was no difference in the PPT at any time point. There was a significant improvement in the OHRQoL domain of psychological discomfort (P = .04) at 12 months. Facial pain intensity, temporomandibular joint pain, mandibular function, and diet were also significantly improved at 12 months (P = .001).Alloplastic TJR appears to decrease pain, improve function and diet, and decrease psychological discomfort.
