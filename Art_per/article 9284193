Abstract : To determine the relationship, in patients with pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction, of histopathological abnormalities to their age at surgery, the severity of pre-operative hydronephrosis and the post-operative outcome.Surgical specimens from 60 consecutive PUJ complexes excised at pyeloplasty were evaluated histologically.There was a close relationship of smooth muscle abnormality and fibrosis with the severity of pre-operative hydronephrosis and post-operative outcome, with no significant correlation between histopathological abnormality and patient age.This study appears to support the practice of the initial non-operative management of congenital PUJ obstruction, potentially reducing the number of early and/or unnecessary interventions. Further investigations and research are necessary to direct appropriate management.
