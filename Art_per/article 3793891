Title : Teratologic dislocation of the hip.
Date : 1986 Nov-Dec
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We reviewed 27 teratologic hip dislocations in 17 patients. Four hips underwent closed reduction, 10 hips had medial adductor open reduction, 9 hips had iliofemoral open reduction, and 4 hips had iliofemoral open reduction and femoral shortening. Avascular necrosis occurred in 48%, redislocation in 19%, and subluxation in 22% of the hips. Results were best in those hips treated by anterior open reduction and femoral shortening and worst in those having closed reduction. Poor results correlated with multiple other involved joints, hypotonia, developmental delay, and poor head control.
