Title : Recent advances in pacemaker and implantable defibrillator therapy for young patients.
Date : 2004
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This review is intended to highlight major clinical advances over the past year related to (1). biventricular pacing as a treatment for dilated myopathy, (2). growing clinical experience with implantable cardioverter defibrillators in pediatrics, (3). technical advances in standard antibradycardia pacing, and (4). an appraisal of the newly updated ACC/AHA/NASPE guidelines for device implant in children and adolescents.Complex rhythm devices are being used more frequently in children. Biventricular pacing to improve ventricular contractility is a rapidly evolving technology that has now been applied to children and young adults with intraventricular conduction delay, such as bundle branch block after cardiac surgery. Implantable defibrillators are also being used for an expanding list of conditions, although lead dysfunction is seen as a fairly common complication in active young patients. Guidelines for device implantation have been developed, but the weight of evidence remains somewhat limited by the paucity of pediatric data in this field.Thanks to refinements in lead design and generator technology, coupled with rapidly expanding clinical indications, pacemakers and implantable defibrillators have become increasingly important components of cardiac therapy for young patients. Expanded multicenter clinical studies will be needed to develop more objective guidelines for use of this advanced technology.
