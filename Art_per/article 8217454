Abstract : Thirty-eight patients with muscular torticollis were treated by a partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle between 1970 and 1981. Clinical evaluations were performed on 35 of these patients who were followed up for 10 years (average of 11.3 years). Of 31 patients under 5 years of age at operation, good results according to Canale's criteria were obtained in 28 (90%). In four patients aged 6 years or more at operation, three showed good results. Postoperatively, massive cotton bandaging was applied with the neck in the neutral position for 3 weeks. A plaster cast, brace, or physiotherapy involving active motion training was not necessary.
