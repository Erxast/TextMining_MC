Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita refers to a clinical condition or syndrome characterised by multiple congenital contractures that affect two or more different areas of the body. Of the cases reported so far, an important percentage had to be terminated before pregnancy term, predominantly by caesarean section. We describe a 36 year-old woman who wanted to conceive. A multidisciplinary approach was set from the preconceptional period and special attention was given to respiratory function, potential anaesthetic difficulties and thromboembolic risks. She delivered by caesarean section at 38 weeks. This case emphasises the possibility of achieving a term delivery in these patients and points out the importance of a multidisciplinary team, specially of obstetricians and anaesthesiologists.
