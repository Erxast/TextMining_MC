Abstract : The muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are inherited diseases of the skeletal muscle, which lead to a loss of muscle function and are often fatal. While many of the loci involved are already known, these conditions remain incurable, and genetic models are being developed in an effort to understand the pathological mechanisms involved. Recently several papers have shown that the zebrafish, which is now widely used in developmental genetic studies, will provide a useful addition to our toolkit in this regard. Here we describe these studies, including a zebrafish model of what is potentially the novel pathological mechanism of muscle attachment failure in Duchenne and other muscular dystrophies.
