Abstract : OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical and radiological evolution of ten patients with Chiari I malformation (CIM), treated surgically.Ten patients with Chiari I malformation underwent suboccipital craniectomy, laminectomy of C1 and dural patch grafting. All of them were followed for at least two years. A magnetic resonance imaging was performed 6 months after surgery. Clinical preoperative evolution and time of installation, results of MRI and clinical postoperative evolution were correlated.In postoperative clinical evolution, we noted an important improvement in sensitive function, decrease of the syringohydromielia and partial improvement of cerebellar functions. Improvement of the motor alteration was less marked. During the two years after treatment the muscular atrophy did not change.Chiari I malformation is a congenital disease with many clinical manifestations which usually increase with time. A suitable diagnostic studies as well as an appropriate treatment are needed to improve the neurological results.
