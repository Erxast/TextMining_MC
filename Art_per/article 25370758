Abstract : To retrospectively evaluate the results of deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) after cardiac surgery.Between January 2010 and September 2013, 139 patients suffering from DSWI after median sternotomy. The incidence of DSWI was 0.47% (139/29 574). There were 111 (79.9%) male and 28 (20.1%) female patients. The mean age was (61 ± 11) years, the mean body weight was (74 ± 14) kg. The incidence of postoperative DSWI was 0.88% (91/10 341) after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 0.70% (15/2 143) after valve surgery or other cardiac surgery plus CABG, 0.21% (24/11 429) after valve surgery, 0.15% (3/2 002) after thoracic aortic surgery, and 0.19% (6/3 158) after congenital heart disease. The sternotomy was re-opened and extensive debridement of the wound was performed in all patients. When the wound was clean and there was a bed of fresh granulation tissue, the sternum was rewired. The surgical procedure performed included debridement, drainage, sternal wire reclosure and pectoralis major muscular transpositions depended on the clinical condition of the patient.The in-hospital mortality was 9.3%. Failure of secondary sternal refixation appeared in 15 (10.8%) patients, the reoperation procedure of these 15 patients was pectoralis major muscular transpositions. Other complications included sepsis in 13 patients, perivalvular leakage in 3 patients, and cardiac rupture during the surgical procedure in 3 patients. The mean hospitalization was (39 ± 30) days.Deep sternal wound infection is a life-threatening complication after cardiac surgery associated with high morbidity and mortality.
