Abstract : Vesical diverticula refer to hernias of the vesical mucous membrane in the detrusor. The diverticulum wall is therefore constituted by the chorion urothelium. The muscular dehiscence that is at the origin of the diverticulum may be either congenital or degenerative. Two important complications of the diverticulum-that are sometimes interwoven-may occur: a draining defect (responsible for infections, lithiasis, and functional signs of the lower urinary tract), and the development of an urothelial tumour in the diverticulum cavity. For such complicated diverticula, surgery is indicated, by endoscopic or retropubic approach. Results may be excellent, provided the surgical intervention focuses at the same time on the management of the associated sub-vesical obstacle in case of acquired diverticulum.
