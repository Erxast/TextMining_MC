Abstract : We report a 38-year-old woman who presented with mild proximal dominant muscle weakness and fatigability that fluctuated during menstruation and treatment with ephedrine-containing medication. The patient had been diagnosed with "congenital myopathy with tubular aggregates" by muscle biopsy at age 19. Her revised diagnosis was congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) caused by a mutation in GFPT1 (2p13.3 [MIM 610542], c.722_723insG homozygote, CMS-GFPT1) based on a screening gene analysis. Muscle CT revealed diffuse atrophy of proximal and axial muscles focused on the vastus lateralis, hamstrings, medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Oral administration of pyridostigmine bromide clearly ameliorated weakness and fatigability. This is the first reported case of CMS-GFPT1 in Japan. Since CMS symptoms are reactive to treatment, it is important for clinicians to make an accurate diagnosis at an early stage to improve patient QOL. Tubular aggregates in muscle biopsy and day-to-day fluctuations are important features of the disorder. Quantitative muscle strength measurement was effective for evaluating treatment efficacy.
