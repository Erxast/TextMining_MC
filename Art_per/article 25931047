Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Bruck syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome consisting of bone fragility and congenital joint contractures. According to the genotype, it has been classified into types 1 and 2. Recently, mutations in FKBP10, localised to chromosome 17q21, have been identified in some patients of Bruck syndrome. Twenty-seven patients of this syndrome have been reported so far. We present a new patient of this syndrome, with frequent fractures, congenital joint contractures, kyphoscoliosis, bilateral clubfoot, and pectus carinatum. The clinical and genetic features of all previously reported cases are also reviewed.
