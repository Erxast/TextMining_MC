Abstract : Experiments, carried out by the author, have shown that the pathogenesis of congenital talipes is based on congenital muscular disbalance between flexors-supinators and extensors-pronators at the expense of strengthening of the former and insufficiency of the latter. An object of treatment of the considered developmental defect is restoration of myogenic balance. The existing methods of conservative treatment result in preservation of insufficiency of the anterolateral group of the crus muscles. Only the method of Vilensky V. Ya. allows to completely solve the posed problem. Operations on the posteromedial section of foot result in reduction of the myogenic disbalance as there is preserved insufficiency of extensors-pronators. Only operations, accompanied by shortening of anterolateral groups of the crus muscles allow to restore the myogenic balance straight on the operating table. The cause of recurrencies in case of congenital talipes is preservation of myogenic disbalance between flexors-spinators and their antagonist more frequent at the expense of insufficiency of the latter.
