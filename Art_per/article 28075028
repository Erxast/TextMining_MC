Abstract : The semaphorins constitute a large family of secreted and membrane-associated proteins that regulate many developmental processes, including neural circuit assembly, bone formation and angiogenesis. Recently, bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in SEMA3A (semaphorin 3A) were identified in a single patient with a particular pattern of multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). Using homozygosity mapping combined with exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous SEMA3A variant causing a premature stop codon in an 8â€‰year old boy with the same pattern of MCA. The phenotype of these patients is characterized by postnatal short stature, skeletal anomalies of the thorax, a minor congenital heart or vascular defect, camptodactyly, micropenis, and variable additional anomalies. Motor development is delayed in both patients, and intellectual development is delayed in one patient. Our observation of a second case supports the notion that bi-allelic mutations in SEMA3A cause an autosomal recessive type of syndromic short stature.
