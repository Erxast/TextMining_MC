Abstract : Muscle biopsies from quadriceps femoris muscle of normal subjects and subjects with symptoms of congenital myopathy, aged 1-3 years, were examined for morphological and biochemical differences. Four patients showed clinical signs of Congenital Fibre Type Disproportion (CFTD) as described originally by Brooke (1973), while the other cases showed only signs of hypotonia and diffuse weakness as described by Clancy et al. (1980). No morphological differences between patients with different clinical signs were found in any biopsy sample from the quadriceps femoris muscle, as regards fibre size; type I fibres were always smaller than type II fibres. The difference in fibre size was more than 15% in all cases, and the variability coefficient of the larger type II fibres was less than 250. Nevertheless, as regards fibre occurrence, two patients showed more type I fibres than type II fibres, four patients showed more type II fibres than type I fibres and one patient had a marked type II fibre predominance. Enzyme activities assayed in the crude mitochondrial fraction showed no abnormalities between normal subjects and patients. An increase in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the crude extract was found in all cases.
