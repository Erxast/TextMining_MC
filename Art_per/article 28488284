Abstract : Striated muscle hamartoma (SMH) is a rare, congenital or acquired, benign tumor that predominantly affects children. Therapeutic management has classically been surgical intervention. We present a pediatric case of a facial plaque-type SMH with spontaneous regression that highlights the importance of clinical observation for a conservative approach.
