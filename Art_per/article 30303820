Abstract : Glycogen storage disease IV (GSD IV), caused by a defect in GBE1, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. A classical hepatic form and a neuromuscular form have been described. The severe neuromuscular form presents as a fetal akinesia deformation sequence or a congenital subtype. We ascertained three unrelated families with fetuses/neonates who presented with fetal akinesia deformation sequence to our clinic for genetic counseling. We performed a detailed clinical evaluation, exome sequencing, and histopathology examination of two fetuses and two neonates from three unrelated families presenting with these perinatally lethal neuromuscular forms of GSD IV. Exome sequencing in the affected fetuses/neonates identified four novel pathogenic variants (c.1459G>T, c.144-1G>A, c.1680C>G, and c.1843G>C) in GBE1 (NM_000158). Histopathology examination of tissues from the affected fetuses/neonate was consistent with the diagnosis. Here, we add three more families with the severe perinatally lethal neuromuscular forms of GSD IV to the GBE1 mutation spectrum.
