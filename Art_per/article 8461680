The programme includes a prospective long term evaluation of family responses to early diagnosis and a comparison of their experiences and perceptions with those families who have undergone the later traditional clinical diagnosis.All maternity units throughout Wales. Samples obtained through screening programme for phenylketonuria and congenital hypothyroidism.Those families whose son had a positive screening test.Creatine kinase activity. Venous blood test to confirm positive result. Molecular genetic mutation analysis. Muscle biopsy and dystrophin analysis. Qualitative measure of satisfaction among affected families.34,219 Boys have been screened and nine affected families have been identified. Eight families were very positive about the programme. Three chose not to complete the diagnostic process.The programme should continue to permit a full evaluation of the issues involved and should serve as a model for other initiatives within the community for genetic disease.
