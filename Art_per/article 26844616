Abstract : Hair follicle nevus (HFN) is a rare hamartomatous lesion of the folliculosebaceous unit, with or without admixed fibroadipose or muscular tissue. It typically has a congenital presentation in the preauricular area of infants and is frequently confused with an accessory tragus. Acquired tumors with similar histopathologic features have been described infrequently during adolescence and adult life. We report yet another unique presentation of this unusual lesion in a 4-year-old girl who had a long-standing tumor of the nasal columella that started growing rapidly after trauma. Histopathologic examination revealed increased numbers of hair follicles, some of which were associated with diminutive sebaceous glands, with no associated central cystic structure. In addition, the infundibula of the follicles were dilated and filled with keratinous debris. Although these hamartomas are common in the head and neck region, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a HFN at this anatomic location. In addition, this tumor has an overall architecture of a HFN but is accompanied by features of a comedo nevus. We also present a review of the literature and summarize the current diagnostic criteria for HFN.
