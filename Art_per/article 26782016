Abstract : We recently evaluated two of the original three patients (siblings) diagnosed with Proximal Myopathy with Focal Depletion of Mitochondria. The condition was named for the distinctive pattern of enlarged mitochondria around the periphery of muscle fibres with a complete absence in the middle. These siblings, aged 37 and 40, are cognitively normal with mild non-progressive muscle weakness and a susceptibility to rhabdomyolysis. Both were shown to be compound heterozygotes for novel mutations (c.263C>T + c.950T>A) in CHKB, the gene currently associated with Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy. Individuals with this condition have early-onset muscle weakness and profound intellectual disability but share the same unique pattern on muscle biopsy as was noted in Proximal Myopathy with Focal Depletion of Mitochondria; focal depletion of mitochondria was surrounded by abnormally large "megaconial" mitochondria. Thus the phenotypic spectrum of CHKB mutations ranges from a congenital muscular dystrophy with intellectual disability to a later-onset non-progressive muscular weakness with normal cognition.
