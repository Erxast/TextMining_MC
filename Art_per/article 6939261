Title : Dysmaturative myopathy. Evolution of the morphological picture in three cases.
Date : 1981
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In a previous paper we grouped together several myopathic pictures as alterations of muscle maturation and we proposed the term of dysmaturative myopathy for them. In this report we shall describe the follow up on three of the original cases, studied 4 1/2, 7 and 6 years after the first biopsy. These cases demonstrate that the muscular picture is not static and that it evolves towards normality. During this evolution, it changes from one to another of the morphological pictures previously described as myotubular and/or centronuclear myopathy, hypotrophy of type I fibers with or without central nuclei and congenital disproportion of types.
