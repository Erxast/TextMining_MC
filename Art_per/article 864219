Date : 1977
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Camptodactyly is a nontraumatic flexion deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The literature pertaining to its etiology and treatment is reviewed. An analysis of 66 patients with 110 affected hands is discussed with particular reference to the natural history of this deformity and the results of 24 operative procedures. Improvement was noted in less than 20% of 32 patients treated nonoperatively and followed for an average of 30 months. Corrective types of operative procedures in 20 hands resulted in improvement in only 35%. A treatment plan dependent on the age of the patient, the presence or absence of osteocartilagenous changes at the proximal interphalangeal joint, and associated anatomic abnormalities is presented.
