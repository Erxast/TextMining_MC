Abstract : Amyoplasia is a rare, sporadic condition characterized by different degrees of maldevelopment of the skeletal muscles, which are replaced by fibrous and fatty tissue. In this report, we present a case of generalized amyoplasia presenting at 19 weeks' gestation. The most striking finding was the absence of fetal movements, resulting in severe multiple congenital contractures, hydrops, and polyhydramnios. At autopsy, histological examination of the skeletal muscle showed small groups of poorly developed fibres within areas of fat. This report suggests that generalized amyoplasia could be a common cause of severe forms of multiple congenital contractures, but is probably underdiagnosed at post-mortem because of inadequate examination of muscles. Definitive diagnosis is important in determining the risks of recurrence in these cases.
