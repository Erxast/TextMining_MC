Abstract : Bartsocas-Papas Syndrome (BPS) is a rare congenital disorder, first described in 1972. It is usually characterized by neonatal or intrauterine death, and, as such, only 26 cases have been reported. Physical manifestations such as antecubital and popliteal pterygia (webbing), syndactyly of fingers, toes and talipes are frequently reported. However, oral, facial, cranial and dental anomalies are often overlooked. This case focuses on the latter anomalies and the effect they have on the facial growth of a 5-year-old patient.
