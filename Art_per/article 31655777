Title : Monogenic Forms of Hypertension.
Date : 2019
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Essential hypertension is a highly prevalent disease in the general population. Secondary hypertension is characterized by a specific and potentially reversible cause of increased blood pressure levels. Some secondary endocrine forms of hypertension are common (caused by uncontrolled cortisol, aldosterone, or catecholamines production). This article describes rare monogenic forms of hypertension, characterized by electrolyte disorders and suppressed renin-aldosterone axis. They represent simple models for the physiology of renal control of sodium levels and plasma volume, thus reaching a high scientific interest. Furthermore, they could explain some features closer to the essential phenotype of hypertension, suggesting a mechanistically driven personalized treatment.
