Abstract : This study was undertaken to examine the possibility of using the latissimus dorsi muscular flap, divided in two parts thus covering the surfaces of the heart, and inserting it into the thoracic cavity by means of a segmental resection of the second rib. After cadaver case studies, 15 operations were performed on 5 Beagle dogs. The first group of 5 operations consisted of a latissimus dorsi flap graft over the heart. The second group and third group of operations (3 and 6 months later) consisted of reoperating for muscular and cardiac biopsies and electrical stimulation tests on the heart-muscle complex. The latissimus dorsi flap provided a sizable mass of contractile tissue. The haemodynamic studies showed no compressive or constrictive phenomenon of the muscle on the heart and revealed the preservation of an appropriate cardiac output for short intervals of time (2 hours), through phasic electrostimulation of the flap. The histopathological studies showed conserved muscular structure. The technical feasibility, histological adaptability and electrophysiological properties of this muscular flap makes it appropriate to develop a functional stimulation programme and perhaps adequate for the treatment of dysplasic, ischemic, tumoral and other acquired or congenital myocardial diseases.
