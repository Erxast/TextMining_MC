Abstract : Small heat shock proteins prevent abnormal protein folding and accumulation. We analyzed the expression of hsp27 and alphaB-crystallin in skeletal muscle specimens of patients with desminopathies, plectinopathies, myotilinopathy, and other myofibrillar myopathies by means of differential centrifugation, 2D-gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. Hsp27-P82 and -P15 as well as alphaB-crystallin-P59 and -P45 are the major serine phosphorylation isoforms in normal and diseased human skeletal muscle. 2D-gel-electrophoresis revealed spots of hsp27 in a range of pH 5.3-6.4 in samples of all skeletal muscle specimens, except for the seven desminopathies. They indicated a shift of the main hsp27-spot to alkaline pH degrees, which may help to differentiate primary desminopathies from other myopathies with structural pathology of the desmin cytoskeleton.
