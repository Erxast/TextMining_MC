Abstract : Myotonic dystrophies (DMs) encompass at least 2 forms: myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2. In general, DMs are late-onset autosomal dominant disorders characterized by a variety of multisystemic features including myotonia, muscular dystrophy, cardiac conduction defects, dilated cardiomyopathy, posterior iridescent cataracts, frontal balding, insulin-resistance and disease-specific serological abnormalities such as gamma-glutamyltransferase and creatine kinase elevations, hyperglycemia, hypotestosteronism, and reduced immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM levels. Beyond the adult forms, in the classic DM1, a congenital form and an early-onset form is recognized. Here we summarize current aspects of the myotonic dystrophy pathogenesis and review the core features of both types of myotonic dystrophies, including the congenital DM1.
