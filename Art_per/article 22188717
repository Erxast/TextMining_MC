Abstract : Nemaline myopathy is a representative form of congenital myopathy, and is characterized by nemaline bodies in muscle fibers. Here we report a 47-year-old man with congenital nemaline myopathy complicated with dilated cardiomyopathy-related heart failure, and restrictive respiratory failure. The complication of dilated cardiomyopathy in nemaline myopathy has rarely been reported. In this case, nemaline bodies were detected in the cardiac muscle fibers, demonstrating the presence of underlying disease-related myocardial degeneration. The patient responded to the combination of conventional therapy for heart failure including Î²-blocker and noninvasive continuous positive-pressure ventilation for respiratory failure. His general condition has been stable during a 10-month follow up period.
