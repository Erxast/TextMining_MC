Abstract : Fibromatoses are a group of benign connective tissue tumors characterized by the infiltrative, aggressive proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts, leading to frequent local recurrence. Within this heterogeneous disease group, superficial fibromatoses show slower growth and more benign infiltration of surrounding tissues than deep fibromatoses. Superficial fibromatoses relevant to dermatology include palmar, plantar, and penile fibromatosis, knuckle pads, pachydermodactyly and infantile digital fibromatosis. They present clinically with subcutaneous nodules or cords that lead to local infiltration and limited mobility of the affected areas. Treatment options vary from watchful waiting, non-invasive methods such as radiotherapy and intralesional corticosteroid/collagenase injections to radical surgical procedures. Early intervention may disrupt disease progression and may even restore functional ability. These disorders should therefore be recognized and treated early in the course of the disease.
