Abstract : Surgical disorders of the central nervous system of children differ significantly from those of adults. The management of these disorders requires an integrated multidisciplinary practice of paediatric specialists in an appropriate paediatric environment. An increasing number of neurosurgeons are now restricting themselves to this field resulting in the more effective diagnosis and treatment of children with neurosurgical disorders.
