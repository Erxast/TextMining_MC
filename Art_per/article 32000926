Title : Differentiating Congenital Myopathy from Congenital Muscular Dystrophy.
Date : 2020
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The congenital muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are a heterogenous group of diseases with a wide variety of presentations and outcomes. With the growing understanding of genetic involvement, and developing therapies, having a genetically confirmed diagnosis with phenotype correlation is essential. To achieve this, a structured approach is warranted to each child to ensure that mimickers are excluded. By structuring the evaluation appropriately, the clinician can help expedite the evaluation of these infants in a cost-effective manner. Understanding the pitfalls of each step of testing will allow the clinician to better understand variants in presentation and avoid cognitive errors in the process.
