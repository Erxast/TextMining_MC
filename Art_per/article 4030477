Title : Myotonia in a chow chow.
Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital myotonia was diagnosed in an inbred Chow Chow pup with severe muscle stiffness that regressed with exercise. Voluntary movement, percussion, or needle insertion caused sustained contraction of the muscles involved. Electromyographic recordings from several muscles contained myotonic discharges. Creatine kinase activity was mildly increased. Slight myofiber hypertrophy and a few atrophic fibers were seen in muscle biopsy specimens. Treatment of the pup with procainamide caused a marked decrease in clinical signs. Myotonia congenita in the Chow Chow appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. This condition can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs. Satisfactory clinical management of myotonia congenita can be achieved with procainamide.
