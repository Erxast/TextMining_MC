Abstract : This study systematically evaluated the symptoms associated with congenital and childhood myotonic dystrophy, and how these symptoms affect health related quality of life. We conducted interviews with patients affected by congenital or childhood myotonic dystrophy and their affected parent to identify which symptoms have the greatest effect on their lives. Each interview was recorded, coded, and analyzed using a qualitative framework technique. In 34 interviews with 13 parents and 21 patients, we identified 189 symptoms, representing 22 themes in physical, emotional, social, and disease-specific quality of life. Communication difficulties, cognitive impairment, and social role limitations were the most frequently identified themes. These interviews identified multiple themes and symptoms, some previously under-recognized, which play a key role in the disease burden associated with congenital and childhood myotonic dystrophy.
