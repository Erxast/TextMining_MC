Abstract : In order to evaluate the developmental status of myofibers in 3 cases of adult centronuclear myopathies (CNM) with type I predominance, we searched for the expression of (a) developmentally regulated cytoskeleton proteins (myosin heavy chains (MHC), vimentin, desmin), and (b) cell surface molecules (neural cell adhesion molecules isoforms, NCAM). Desmin intermediate filaments were overexpressed in some fibers with centrally located nuclei and radially organized. Muscle fibers do not express vimentin. These findings were not observed in muscle biopsies from disease controls with numerous central nuclei. Few myofibers (less than 5%) expressed developmental MHC together with either embryonic NCAM or adult NCAM and rare fibers only expressed adult NCAM. Most of the remaining fibers neither expressed NCAM nor developmental MHC but were slow MHC positive. These features do not favor the hypothesis of a general arrest of muscle fiber maturation in adult CNM. It is more likely that fibers undergo a very slow developmental process with a long delay of innervation as shown by some fibers with NCAM expression. Nevertheless, innervation appears to be successful, as suggested by the large number of NCAM negative fibers. Moreover, the abnormal myofiber distribution could be related to this functional disturbance of innervation.
