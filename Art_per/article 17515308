Date : 2007
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report on a patient with congenital distal limb contractures, characteristic face, prominent metopic sutures, narrow forehead, severe psychomotor and growth retardation, white matter lesions and failure to thrive. The child has many overlapping features with those reported previously by Chitayat. We suggest that the central nervous anomalies are responsible for the congenital contractures in Chitayat syndrome.
