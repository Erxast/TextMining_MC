Date : 2004
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a boy with severe congenital myopathy, Möbius-Poland sequence, Robin sequence, and severe developmental delay. We consider this patient to have Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome. Since this is only the seventh case reported, this case helps to define further the consistent manifestations of this recognizable phenotype. Additionally our patient shows laryngostenosis, intermittent episodes of high blood pressure and Poland sequence as important clinical symptoms.
