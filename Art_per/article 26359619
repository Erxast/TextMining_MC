Abstract : Rigid equinovarus foot is a challenging problem. Talectomy has been advocated as a salvage procedure to achieve a plantigrade painless foot in the treatment of rigid equinovarus deformity. The present prospective observational study evaluated the effectiveness of talectomy in the treatment of Dimeglio grade IV rigid equinovarus feet. Nineteen feet in 13 patients were treated by talectomy from September 2001 through January 2012 (10-year, 2-month period). Of the 13 patients, 9 (69.23%) had a foot deformity due to arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and 1 (7.69%) each due to sacral agenesis, spastic cerebral palsy, neglected congenital talipes equinovarus, and post-traumatic contracture. Of the 13 patients, 9 (69.23%) were male and 4 (30.77%) were female. Their mean age was 7.7 (range 3 to 26) years. The mean follow-up duration was 6.4 (range 2 to 11) years. Along with talectomy, excision of the navicular was performed in 8 feet (42.11%), calcaneal osteotomy with a laterally based wedge in 8 (42.11%), and calcaneocuboid fusion in 3 feet (15.79%). Postoperatively, all the feet improved to Dimeglio grade II and were painless, and 16 feet (84.22%) were plantigrade; 1 foot (5.26%) had residual equinus resulting from incomplete removal of the talus and 2 (10.53%) had residual varus. Also, 3 feet (15.79%) had forefoot adduction (2 residual and 1 recurrent) that required a second surgery to correct the deformity. From our experience, talectomy is an effective procedure for correction of severe rigid equinovarus feet, provided that the talus is completely removed and the calcaneus is positioned correctly in the ankle mortise.
