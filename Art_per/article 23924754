Abstract : Congenital fiber type disproportion with delayed fiber type maturation and the appearance of cap structures were analyzed in a child with p.Arg168Gly mutation in TPM3 gene. Very narrow myotube-like Type 1 fibers with single nuclei decorated by cap structures seem to be a result of a failure in fusion process and mature fiber formation. Repeated mutations in exon 5 of TPM3 gene giving cap structures may be a different consequence of the loss of specific isoform normally operating in the fusion process and sarcomer formation.
