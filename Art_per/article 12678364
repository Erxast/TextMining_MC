Title : Quadricepsplasty for knee stiffness after femoral lengthening in congenital short femur.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We review the results of a modified quadricepsplasty in five children who developed stiffness of the knee after femoral lengthening for congenital short femur using an Ilizarov external fixator which spanned the knee. All had a full range of movement of the knee before lengthening was undertaken. Unifocal lengthening was carried out in the distal metaphysiodiaphyseal region of the distal femur with a mean gain of 6.5 cm. The mean percentage lengthening was 24%. At the end of one year after removal of the Ilizarov frame and despite intensive physiotherapy all patients had stiffness. Physiotherapy was continued after the quadricepsplasty and, at the latest follow-up (mean 27 months), the mean active flexion was 102 degrees (80 to 130). The gain in movement ranged from 50 degrees to 100 degrees. One patient had a superficial wound infection which settled after a course of oral antibiotics. None developed an increased extension lag after surgery and all were very satisfied with the results. Quadricepsplasty is a useful procedure for stiffness of the knee after femoral lengthening which has not responded to physiotherapy.
