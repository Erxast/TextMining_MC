Abstract : Although numerous studies have been performed on congenital trigger thumb (CTT), the pathogenesis is still unknown. Cytocontractile proteins and myofibroblasts are present during soft-tissue contraction, and they may have a role in CTT. The aim of the study is to clarify the immunohistochemical and the electron microscopy characteristics of the first annular (A-1) pulley in CTT. The specimens from the A-1 pulleys were collected from 22 children with CTT. Electron microscopy was used to study the last five specimens. Immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that all specimens stained positively for vimentin and for Î±-smooth muscle actin, and stained negatively for desmin. Electron microscopy showed fibroblasts in collagenous matrix, which contain vimentin-like material and associated at the surface with elastin-like tubular matrix filaments and elastin fibers. In two specimens, a few cells showed markers of myofibroblastic differentiation. The presence of the cytocontractile proteins and myofibroblasts suggests proliferation of fibrous tissues during either the intrauterine or extrauterine phase of development and may account for the presence of congenital stenosis at the level of the A-1 pulley. We believe that CTT may be developmental; if the process started in the intrauterine phase it might present as a fixed flexion contracture and will show mature fibroblasts. If the process started in the extrauterine phase, it might present as triggering first and will show myofibroblastic changes, then with the maturation of the fibrous tissue, result in a fixed flexion contracture.
