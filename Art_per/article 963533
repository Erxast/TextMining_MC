Title : Benign myopathy, with autosomal dominant inheritance. A report on three pedigrees.
Date : 1976
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Three pedigrees are described in which 28 living siblings suffered from a benign myopathy. The first symptoms were observed around the fifth year of life. The proximal muscles were more involved than the distal muscles, the extensors more than the flexors. Due to a marked paresis of the extensor digitorum communis muscles 22 patients showed a flexion contracture of the interphalangeal joints of the last four fingers. In addition 20 patients showed a flexion contracture of the elbows and 12 patients had a plantar flexion contracture of the ankles. A high incidence of congenital torticollis was found. The histopathological features were non-specific and remarkably uniform and consisted of a marked variation in muslce fibre diameter and a very marked increase of fatty tissue. Light-microscopy and electronmicroscopy did not show any specific structural changes. There was normal distribution of type I and type II fibres, without type-grouping or preferential atrophy of one of the fibre types. Lobulated type I fibres were found in 6 out of 12 biopsies. Post-mortem study of one case did not show any convincing features of a neurogenic disorder. As no relationship could be found between the siblings of the 3 pedigrees as far back as the beginning of the eighteenth century, this myopathy seemed to be a new nosological entity.
