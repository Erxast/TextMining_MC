Title : [The morphology and constitution-based criteria for the assessment of individual risk for the development of vibration disease].
Date : 1999
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors studied morphologic and constitutional features in individuals with various durability to vibration. Patients fragile to vibration were pectoral and indefinite somatotypes with connective tissue dysplasia and small congenital abnormalities (spondylodysplasia, venous wall deficiency. "dysplastic" heart signs and others). Patients durable to vibration were muscular and abdominal somatotypes with rare connective tissue dysplasia and small congenital abnormalities (2.5-10.2% of cases). Evaluation of morphologic and constitutional characteristics is recommended in preliminary and periodic medical examinations of workers subjected to vibration, for assessment of individual risk degree and differential medical follow-up.
