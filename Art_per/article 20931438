Abstract : Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by thymidine phosphorylase deficiency. The disease is characterized clinically by ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoparesis, severe gastrointestinal dysmotility, peripheral neuropathy, leukoencephalopathy, and mitochondrial abnormalities.
