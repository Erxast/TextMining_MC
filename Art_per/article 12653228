Abstract : The authors present a review of 14 patients with temporomandibular joint ankylosis treated between March 1992 and February 1997. Etiology of the ankylosis was trauma in four patients, ear infection in two, systemic infection in one case, congenital in another, and unknown in six. Patients were divided into two groups, according to their age: 16 years and under and over 16 years of age. The basic principle of surgical treatment in both groups is ample access for osseous resection and coronoidectomy. Costochondral grafts were used in group one (nine patients), while interposition of a silicone block, was performed in the second group (five patients). Follow-up evaluations were from twelve to 53 months (average 28.2 months). One case of recurrence occurred in the first group and no recurrences in the second group. The average long-term mouth opening in both groups was 32.8 mm.
