Title : Distraction osteogenesis in congenital limb length discrepancy: a review.
Date : 1996
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This paper reviews the technique of callotasis used to correct limb length discrepancy due to congenital causes. Many more lower than upper limb lengthening procedures have been reported. Despite the low complication rate reported by the originators of the technique, patients undergoing limb lengthening because of congenital problems are at significant risk of pin tract sepsis, joint contracture, nerve palsies, angular deformities and fracture through the regenerate bone. A minority of studies focus specifically on limb lengthening for congenital defects. Most series simply include some congenital patients, but it is difficult to retrieve the data, and to generalize from them. The amount of lengthening with an acceptable complication rate should not exceed 25%; of the initial bone length. Even using circular frames with small pins, practically all patients may be expected to develop at least one complication each, ranging from pin tract infection to the necessity of carrying out additional unplanned operative procedures either during or after the treatment period. The prevalence of major complications seems to be correlated with the complexity and the duration of the treatment. The functional outcome and the psychological problems associated with a lengthy procedure, which may require long periods of repeated hospitalization, have only rarely been studied. However, it appears that prolonged strength loss is frequent, and that significant psychological morbidity is experienced. Patients and their families should be counselled before and during the procedure on these lesser known aspects of callotasis lengthening.
