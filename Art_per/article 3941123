Title : Intraspinal rhizotomy and distal cordectomy in patients with myelomeningocele.
Date : 1986
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Intraspinal rhizotomy alone or in combination with excision of the scarred conus medullaris distal to the level of the cord anomaly was used in thirteen patients with myelomeningocele at the thoracolumbar level whose care was complicated by recurrent deformity of the lower extremities that was caused by persistent spasticity. When examined at an average follow-up of 5.3 years, all patients were free of spasticity, had manageable lower extremities, and were able to sit in a wheelchair with ease. Twelve patients had no change in the status of the urinary tract, but one patient noted an adverse change in urinary status with increased wetness between intermittent catheterizations. Intraspinal rhizotomy alone or in combination with distal cordectomy should be used only in patients with congenital paraplegia in whom reflex motor activity has caused recurrent deformity of the lower extremities that cannot be controlled by the use of braces or operations on the lower extremities, or both.
