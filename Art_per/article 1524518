Title : Early predictors of poor outcome in congenital fiber-type disproportion myopathy.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report the cases of eight children with histologic findings in the muscle of congenital fiber-type disproportion myopathy. Five had severe muscle weakness at birth; three of them died at 6 months, 18 months, and 6.5 years of age, respectively, and the other two are ventilator dependent and need total care at 2.5 and 4 years of age. The five children with severe weakness at birth had profound respiratory muscle weakness and needed assisted ventilation since early infancy. They also had severe facial and bulbar muscle weakness that required tube feeding, and four had gastrostomy. Ptosis and marked external ophthalmoparesis were also noted. Our study shows that the presence of the above constellation of signs at birth or in early infancy is a predictor of a high rate of mortality in infancy and poor developmental outcome in the survivors.
