Abstract : Orthopedic deformities in the lower limb concern all joints (hip, knee, ankle, foot) with a wide range of clinical forms. Spasticity, contracture, stiffness, laxity, neurological deficit are assessed to establish the surgical procedure. Surgical techniques are adapted to the goals that are detailed with the patient and his family: standing, transferring, walking, hygiene, devices (shoes, orthosis, canes, wheelchair). Surgical procedures can associate: lengthening of contractured muscles (tenotomy with or without sutures, fractional lengthening at the musculo-tendinous junction or desinsertion), strengthening of antagonists (passive or active tendon transfer) and correction of joint deformity (arthrolysis, arthrodesis, arthroplasty). In adults, the most common deformities are the equinus or equinovarus foot, toe curling, hip adductum, knee flessum. Talus or knee recurvatum are less frequently observed. The association of various deformities raises questions concerning the hierarchy of surgical procedure, from an anatomical point of view (do we start with proximal or distal joint first?) as from chronological concerns (shall we do one or more procedures?). Pluridisciplinary assessment using neurological anesthetic blocs and dynamic EMG or gait analysis is necessary to detail the aims of surgery and choose the surgical procedures.
