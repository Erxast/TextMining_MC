Abstract : A 56-year-old man gradually developed paresthesia and muscular weakness of the left hand and feet for two years. On admission, neurological examination showed predominantly sensory polyneuropathy. Electrophysiological study and sural nerve biopsy demonstrated segmental demyelination, but any underlying congenital, toxic, metabolic or neoplastic cause was failed to reveal. The serum IgM level was 576 mg/dl, while IgG and IgA were normal. An immunoblot analysis and ELISA showed serum IgM antibody that reacted with human MAG. Serum IgM M-protein, however, was detectable not by conventional serum protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis, but by immunofixation. Anti-MAG antibodies should be evaluated in the patients with slowly progressive demyelinating polyneuropathy of unknown etiology, even if no serum M-protein is detected by conventional methods. Serum M-protein may play a role of pathogenesis of demyelination, and immunofixation method could be beneficial to detect small amount of M-protein.
