Abstract : The diagnosis of and therapy for paediatric ptosis present challenges because of difficulties in performing preoperative examinations and the inability of the patient to provide intraoperative cooperation for proper lid placement. The authors provide an overview of the different forms and findings in congenital ptosis patients and point out the difficulties of the surgical procedures.The majority of paediatric ptosis cases is simple unilateral congenital ptosis with dysgenesis of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Other different forms exist due to neurological, neuro-myogenic, aponeurotic, sympathic, and mechanical reasons or syndromes. The relevant history is obtained, including birth history and family history, careful observation and full ophthalmological examination are necessary. Amblyopia because of ptosis, strabismus or anisometropia with corneal astigmatism should be recognised and treated early. The preoperative examination is vital for determining the appropriate diagnosis and is useful for selecting the appropriate procedure. Ptosis correction is based on ptosis severity, Bell phenomenon and levator function. The primary goal is symmetry of the upper lids. Most frequently a levator resection is performed between the 3rd and 5th year with a levator function of more than 3 mm. The most common complication is undercorrection, poor lid contour or amblyopia. Overcorrection may be associated with dry eye syndrome and keratopathy.Levator resection is a useful procedure for the correction of mild to moderate ptosis. Frontalis suspension surgery is effective for congenital ptosis with poor levator function.
