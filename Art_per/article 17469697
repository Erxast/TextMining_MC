Abstract : Three types of historical events are of interest, when dealing with the topic of abdominal compartment syndrome. The first concerns the evolution in the understanding of the pathophysiologic features of a compartment syndrome in general. The symptoms were well described by Richard von Volkmann in the 19th century. The second consists of the experimental studies devoted to measurements of intra-abdominal pressure. Different devices and techniques were used, in particular using detection locations approachable via natural body orifices (bladder/uterus/rectum etc). A third point of interest has come forward after the empirical assessment, in particular by sir Heneage Ogilvie that open laparostomies were beneficial in the healing of great abdominal war wounds, or later, of congenital abdominal wall defects. These three different views on pathology and treatment of life threatening abdominal hypertension have evolved to a concept of abdominal compartment syndrome, that with adequate diagnostic measures and accurate and timely intervention can now be treated with great success.
