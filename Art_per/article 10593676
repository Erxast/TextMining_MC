Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital glaucoma and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were the predominant presenting signs in a patient with Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Thereafter, he developed short stature, pigmentary retinopathy, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. The diagnosis was confirmed by detecting a deletion of mitochondrial DNA in muscle, thus demonstrating that Kearns-Sayre syndrome can have the unusual presenting signs described above.
