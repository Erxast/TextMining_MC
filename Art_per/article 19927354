Abstract : This study aims to perform gene diagnosis for nine patients with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) and their parents with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and to carry out prenatal gene diagnosis for one of them. Genomic DNA of the peripheral blood and fetal amniotic fluid cell was extracted from the pedigrees' members with DMD/BMD. Gene diagnosis was performed for theses pedigrees' members using a SALSA KIT. Short tandem repeats (STR) genotyping and X-linkage analysis were performed for the pedigree members of the fetus, which was used in the prenatal diagnosis. MLPA analysis results show that five of nine patients (DMD-1, DMD-2, DMD-4, DMD-8, and DMD-9) with DMD/BMD were found to have several hemizygous exon deletions in the dystrophin gene. The other patients and the fetus did not have any hemizygous deletion or duplication of any exons. The genomic DNA of the fetus was not contaminated by his mother's DNA as identified by STR genotyping. In addition, X-linkage analysis results show that the only X chromosome of the fetus comes from one of his mother's normal X chromosomes. Combined with STR genotyping and X-linkage analysis, MLPA is a convenient, highly effective and reliable gene diagnosis technique for congenital genetic disease.
