Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an uncommon childhood cardiac disease and can be primary or secondary. Several systemic diseases are known to be associated with this entity. Senger's disease is a mitochondrial disorder causing congenital cataracts lactic acidosis and skeletal and cardiac myopathy. Diagnosis should be kept in mind when routine neonatal eye screening reveals absent red reflex. The authors report a case of Sengers disease and discuss the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.
