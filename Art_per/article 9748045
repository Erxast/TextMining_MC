Abstract : A 5-week-old boy became rigid and developed cardiac arrest after receiving succinylcholine. He was resuscitated and ventilated but died at 5 months. Muscle biopsy demonstrated no neurogenic features and numerous cytoplasmic bodies, suggesting the possibility of congenital myopathy with cytoplasmic bodies. However, molecular analysis revealed a homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene, suggesting that the patient had Werdnig-Hoffmann disease. We recommend that every patient with congenital cytoplasmic body myopathy be tested for SMN gene deletion.
