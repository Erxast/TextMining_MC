Abstract : As the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) population ages, it is essential that we understand the late-stage health profile and provide the appropriate care for this emerging population.We undertook a descriptive study to document the health profile of a cohort of adults with DMD using data from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance Tracking and Research network (MD STARnet). Data included information collected from Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Georgia, and 12 counties in western New York on individuals born since January 1982 and followed through December 2012.In 208 adults with DMD, the number of individuals (N) and median ages (years) at which certain critical milestones were crossed and interventions initiated were as follows: development of cardiomyopathy, N = 145 (16.7); initiation of non-invasive ventilation, N = 99 (18.0); gastrostomy, N = 47 (19.0); and death, N = 59 (21.8).These population-based data provide critical information about late-stage health profiles among adults with DMD for developing appropriate models of care.
