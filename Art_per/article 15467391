Abstract : Animal cells contain many glycoproteins, i.e. , proteins with covalently liked sugar chains. The major glycans of glycoproteins can be classified into two groups, N-glycans and O-glycans, according to their glycan-peptide linkage regions. Development of sensitive methods for the analyses of glycan structures have revealed a new type of glycosidic linkage to the peptide portion, the O-mannosyl linkage, in mammals, which used to be considered specific to yeast. O-Mannosylation is present in a limited number of glycoproteins of brain, nerve, and skeletal muscle. Recently O-mannosylation has been shown to be important in muscle and brain development. Glycobiology of O-mannosyl glycans is expected to produce remarkable advances in the understanding and treatment of congenital muscular dystrophies. In this article, I describe the structure, biosynthesis, and pathology of O-mannosyl glycans.
