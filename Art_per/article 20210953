Abstract : To report a case of multiple acquired jejunal pseudodiverticula managed successfully by resection and jejunojejunostomy.Clinical report.Arabian filly.The filly was referred for signs of acute colic of several hours duration and had a 2-week history of inappetence and weight loss. Three meters of thickened, edematous, and dilated jejunum removed during exploratory celiotomy had an intussusception and numerous diverticula; jejunojejunostomy performed. The pathoanatomic diagnosis was proliferative enteropathy with pseudodiverticula formation and jejunal muscular hypertrophy and diverticulosis. The diverticula appeared to be acquired; however, the exact cause was not determined.There were no postoperative gastrointestinal complications and 1 year later, the filly was doing well.Multiple acquired jejunal pseudodiverticula not associated with classic muscular hypertrophy can occur in young horses. Long-term prognosis seemingly can be excellent after resection and jejunojejunostomy.Compared with other reports of small intestinal diverticula in horses, this case is unique because it was not congenital or associated with classic muscular hypertrophy.
