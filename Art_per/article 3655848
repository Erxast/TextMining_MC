Abstract : In 1981 a report appeared of a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy associated with dwarfism caused by growth hormone deficiency, in whom the muscular disease was unusually benign. The authors suggested that the benign course might be related to the growth hormone deficiency and dwarfism. Other authors later supported this idea, having observed that in dystrophic mice and hamsters with congenital and experimentally induced pituitary dwarfism, respectively, pathological expressions of the dystrophy were markedly reduced. In this paper one case of Becker and one of limb-girdle dystrophy, each associated with short stature and growth hormone deficiency are described. In these cases the disease did not have a particularly benign course. It is concluded that caution is necessary, at least in certain cases, before an association between reduced muscular growth and the dystrophic process can be assumed.
