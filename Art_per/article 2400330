Abstract : By means of a complex of anatomical, morphometrical and histological methods in 45 normally formed and in 179 abnormally developed hearts from persons of both sex died at various age, various links of the venous blood outflow from the myocardium have been investigated. Various parts, differing in a number of morphological signs, have been distinguished: coronary sinus, subepicardial veins, paired sinusoid veins, sinusoids of the myocardium and endocardial eversions. Regulation of their blood stream is performed by a system of simple muscular and infundibular valves, by intimal and muscular cushions, by connective tissue and muscular bridges. These adaptive structures occur in the normal heart also, but at congenital heart diseases, however, they reach an essentially greater development. Their localization is predominantly in the area of venular, vein, sinusoid bifurcations and endocardial eversions. Regular functioning of some parts of them is performed not by nonstriated, but by the cardiac muscular tissue. The coordinating work of the formation in question is one of the factors, that ensures the state of compensation in the defectively formed heart.
