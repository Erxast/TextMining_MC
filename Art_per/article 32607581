Abstract : Autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in the filamin C gene (FLNC) have been associated with myofibrillar myopathies, distal myopathies, and isolated cardiomyopathies. Mutations in different functional domains of FLNC can cause various clinical phenotypes. A novel heterozygous missense variant c.608G>A, p.(Cys203Tyr) in the actin binding domain of FLCN was found to cause an upper limb distal myopathy (MIM #614065). The muscle MRI findings are similar to those observed in FLNC-myofibrillar myopathy (MIM #609524). However, the muscle biopsy revealed >20% of muscle fibers with nemaline bodies, in addition to numerous ring fibers and a predominance of type 1 fibers. Overall, this case shows some unique and rare aspects of FLNC-myopathy constituting a new morphologic phenotype of FLNC-related myopathies.
