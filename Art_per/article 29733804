Abstract : Bilateral nontraumatic temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation is an acute situation that can lead to a chronic and recurrent condition. Few pediatric cases have been reported in the literature and no standardized care protocol has been established to date.Two cases of chronic bilateral dislocation of the TMJ in young children are reported and their medical management is discussed based on data from the literature.A 26 months-old child and a 19-months old child were included. Both had chronic bilateral TMJ dislocation managed using a combination of reduction under nitrous oxide sedation, reduction under general anesthesia, chin-to-vertex bandage and orthodontic headgear.TMJ dislocations in children raise specific concerns such as the need for screening for underlying congenital disorders of connective tissues. Furthermore, surgical options in children are very limited. The authors propose a standardized management protocol for recurrent joint dislocation in pediatric populations based on 2 new cases and data from the literature.
