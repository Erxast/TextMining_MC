Abstract : Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of metabolic diseases due to defects in protein and lipid glycosylation. We searched for the primary defect in 3 children from 2 families with a severe neurological phenotype, including profound developmental delay, intractable epilepsy, progressive microcephaly, severe hypotonia with elevated blood creatine kinase levels, and early fatal outcome. There was clinical evidence of a muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy syndrome, supported by deficient O-mannosylation by muscle immunohistochemistry.Biochemical and molecular methods were combined to pinpoint the defect in the glycosylation pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum.Metabolic investigations revealed CDG-I, pointing to a defect in protein N-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Analysis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in fibroblasts showed accumulation of Dol-PP-GlcNAc(2) -Man(5) . DNA analysis revealed mutations in DPM2, 1 of the subunits of the dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthase; the patient in the first family is compound heterozygous for 2 mutations (c.68A>G, predicting a missense mutation p.Y23C and c.4-1G>C, a splice mutation), whereas the patients in the second family are homozygous for the same missense mutation (c.68A>G, p.Y23C).We describe a new CDG, due to a deficiency of DPM2. Hence, mutations have now been described in the genes for the 3 subunits of DPM: DPM1, DPM2, and DPM3, whereby DPM2-CDG links the congenital disorders of glycosylation to the congenital muscular dystrophies.
