Abstract : Physical activity is associated with positive health effects, but individuals with neuromuscular disease (NMD) may experience constraints being physically active. There is a gap in the literature on the activity level of people with NMDs, and therefore we did a study to determine the physical activity level in people with Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT).This study used a cross-sectional design to obtain self-reported physical activity and sitting time among individuals with LGMD and CMT who were recruited from the Norwegian registry for hereditary and congenital neuromuscular diseases.A total of 127 respondents who filled out questionnaires about either physical activity or sitting time were included in the analysis. Seventy (55.1%) had a diagnosis of CMT and 57 (44.9%) had a diagnosis of LGMD. Seventy-three (57.5%) respondents were female and 54 (42.5%) were male. Among the 108 respondents with available physical activity data, 44.4% reported being physically inactive. Among the 109 respondents with available sitting time data, the average sitting time was 8.6 h. Longer sitting time was associated with higher physical inactivity.Among people with LGMD and CMT in our study, 55.6% reported being physically active. Respondents with LGMD and CMT reported longer sitting time and less physical activity compared with healthy respondents in other studies. Further research should explore variables and measures that can promote physical activity among people with neuromuscular conditions.
