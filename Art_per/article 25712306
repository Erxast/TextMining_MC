Abstract : Distal arthrogryposis (DA) encompasses a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders with multiple congenital contractures predominant in the distal extremities. A total of 10 subtypes are proposed based on the pattern of contractures and association with extraarticular symptoms. DA5 is defined as a subtype with ptosis/oculomotor limitation. However, affected individuals have a variety of non-ocular features as well. We report on a two-generation family, including four affected individuals who all had congenital contractures of the distal joints, ptosis, restricted ocular movements, distinct facial appearance with deep-set eyes, and shortening of the 1st and 5th toes. The proband and her affected mother had restrictive lung disease, a recently recognized syndromic component of DA5, while younger patients did not. The proband had metacarpal and metatarsal synostosis, and the mother showed excavation of the optic disk. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous mutation c.4456G>C (p.A1486P) of PIEZO2. PIEZO2 encodes a mechanosensitive ion channel, malfunction of which provides pleiotropic effects on joints, ocular muscles, lung function, and bone development.
