Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disease characterized by widespread soft tissue ossification and congenital stigmata of the extremities. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with clinical and radiological features of FOP. She was born with bilateral hallux valgus and at the age of 10 presented swelling and ossification of the left scapula. During the course of the disease numerous crises were observed. In this patient authors noticed FOP exacerbation after a surgical operation.
