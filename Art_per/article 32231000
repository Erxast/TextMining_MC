Abstract : Mutations in the <i>LMNA</i> gene, encoding the nuclear envelope A-type lamins, are responsible for muscular dystrophies, the most severe form being the <i>LMNA</i>-related congenital muscular dystrophy (L-CMD), with severe defects in myonucleus integrity. We previously reported that L-CMD mutations compromise the ability of muscle stem cells to modulate the yes-associated protein (YAP), a pivotal factor in mechanotransduction and myogenesis. Here, we investigated the intrinsic mechanisms by which lamins influence YAP subcellular distribution, by analyzing different conditions affecting the balance between nuclear import and export of YAP. In contrast to wild type (WT) cells, <i>LMNA</i><sup>DK32</sup> mutations failed to exclude YAP from the nucleus and to inactivate its transcriptional activity at high cell density, despite activation of the Hippo pathway. Inhibiting nuclear pore import abolished YAP nuclear accumulation in confluent mutant cells, thus showing persistent nuclear import of YAP at cell confluence. YAP deregulation was also present in congenital myopathy related to nesprin-1<sup>ÔÅÑKASH</sup> mutation, but not in cells expressing the <i>LMNA</i><sup>H222P</sup> mutation, the adult form of lamin-related muscle dystrophy with reduced nuclear deformability. In conclusion, our data showed that L-CMD mutations increased YAP nuclear localization via an increased nuclear import and implicated YAP as a pathogenic contributor in muscle dystrophies caused by nuclear envelop defects.
