Abstract : Spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease related to SACS gene and characterized by cerebellar, pyramidal and some other signs. The disease was delineated in Quebec, where it cumulates due to founder effect and has similar phenotype with very early onset. ARSACS in other populations is more variable. The first Russian case of ARSACS in a 37-year-old woman, an only patient in a Lak (one of Dagestan ethnicities) family, is presented. Along with main typical features, she had atypical late disease onset (in 32 years) and moderate cognitive decline. MPS-panel 'hereditary paraplegias' detected an earlier reported homo- or hemizygous mutation c.72276C>T (p.Arg2426Stop) in SACS exon 10.
