Abstract : Camptodactyly is a permanent non-traumatic flexion contracture at the proximal interphalangeal joint, involving most of the time the fifth finger. This condition is rare (incidence is inferior to 1%). Most of the cases are sporadic, although some authors have traced the transmission through several generations. Two types of camptodactyly have been described, depending on the age of onset (within the first year of age or in adolescent). This condition can also be described as "static" or "dynamic", depending on the effect of MP flexion on the PIP extension lag. Many anatomical abnormalities have been evoked as potential aetiology for camptodactyly, including variations in the lumbrical or flexor superficialis origin or distal insertions. However, after a few years without treatment, permanent flexion position of the joint adds its own effects and leads to joint contracture, regardless of the aetiology of camptodactyly. Treatment is required for this condition for extension deficit greater than 30 degrees. The first step will always consists of dynamic splinting of the PIP joint. If improvement is not obtained through dynamic splinting alone, surgery can be considered. Correction of a well defined anatomical abnormality is part of the treatment. When required, it will be associated to correction of joint and soft tissue contracture.
