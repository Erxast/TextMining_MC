Title : Chimerism in myositis.
Date : 2003
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Bidirectional cell trafficking occurs between a mother and fetus during pregnancy. The trafficking is associated with the persistence of non-self cells. Persistence of these cells has been demonstrated after birth for many years in the child and mother. Children and adults with inflammatory myositis are reported to have persistence of microchimeric cells more often than healthy individuals in their peripheral blood and muscle tissue.
