Abstract : To review pseudotumor of infancy (POI) and congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) and to suggest an algorithm for treatment.Retrospective review of cases from 1962 to 1998 at a tertiary care center.Patients included in this study were 81 boys and 89 girls who had a diagnosis of POI (n = 38) or CMT (n = 132) before 24 months of age.For all patients, the mean age at diagnosis was 4 months; 54.1% had the left side of the neck affected, over 90% had a head tilt, and 2.4% had feeding difficulty as a result of the disorder. Plagiocephaly was present in 39.5% of patients with POI and 63.6% of patients with CMT; a neck mass, in 63.2% and 18.2%, respectively; and facial asymmetry, in 7.9% and 15.9%, respectively. All patients had a complete physical examination; 54.1% had plain cervical radiography, 4.1%, computed tomography, and 2.9%, ultrasonography. Passive range of motion was the initial treatment recommended for 65.3% of patients. Conservative treatment failed for 16 patients; subsequently, they had surgical treatment. Follow-up data were available for 159 patients; 85.5% experienced total resolution and 14.5% experienced subtotal resolution or long-term abnormality.Children diagnosed with POI or CMT should be treated and observed for at least 12 months or until symptoms resolve. If symptoms persist 1 year after diagnosis despite conservative therapy, surgical treatment should be considered. The majority of children with POI or CMT experience total resolution of symptoms.
