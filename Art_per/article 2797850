Abstract : Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita is a congenital syndrome characterized by multiple contractures, rigid joints, and significant limitation of movement. Intervention, beginning in infancy, requires a comprehensive, holistic, family-centered approach. Long-range goals include achieving maximum range-of-motion and independence in accomplishing activities of daily living. Nursing care must address the developmental, physical, and emotional needs of the child as well as the psychologic concerns and educational needs of parents. The nurse acts as the coordinator of care to assure that the child receives all necessary services, including therapy, social services, and community support. Collaboration between nurse, parents, and other health care providers is crucial to the development and implementation of a long-term therapeutic plan of care which will enhance mobility and independence.
