Abstract : Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare disorder characterized by near complete absence of adipose tissue from birth. At least 2 genes located in 9q34 (AGPAT2) and 11q13 (Seipin) are implicated in type 1 and 2, respectively, and result in insulin resistance. We report here a novel case of CGL type 1 resulting from a novel homozygote mutation in the AGPAT2 gene. The clinical picture included pseudoathletic muscular hypertrophy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, enlarged liver, hypermetabolism rate, and hyperinsulinemia in a 1-year-old child from Libya. Peripheral hypertonia and reflex excitability revealed signal abnormalities in white matter on magnetic resonance imagery, which has not been described previously in the literature.
