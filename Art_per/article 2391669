Title : A technique for construction of dynamic oral commissure retractors.
Date : 1990
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Microstomia may result from congenital defects, trauma, or surgery. Regardless of the etiology, the scar contracture can result in deformities that produce esthetic and functional disturbances. The literature described the use of static and dynamic commissure retractors. This article describes a technique for constructing commissure retractors from resilient mouth protector material reinforced with stainless steel wire. The tension of the commissure retractors is controlled with elastic bands attached to an orthodontic neck strap. The use of the retractor and the need for careful follow-up are addressed. The dynamic commissure retractors described have been used clinically with success. Research is required to quantify the qualitative and quantitative improvements in reducing microstomia with these retractors.
