Abstract : We studied 10 members of a 4 generation Missouri kindred with a dominant mental retardation syndrome with increasing severity in males. The 21 year-old propositus presented with severe mental retardation, microcephaly, asymmetric face, exotropia, hypogonadism, joint hypermobility, rocker bottom feet, and 10 low digital arches. Two brothers and a male cousin had similar features. The mother, sister, niece, maternal aunt, female cousin, and grandmother were examined and each had 8 to 10 low digital arches. Five of the women had exotropia and one had pes cavus feet. Chromosome analysis for fragile X in multiple relatives was normal. To determine the likelihood that this was an X-linked syndrome. DNA from relatives was hybridized to probes which detect 13 different loci spanning the X-chromosome. A peak LOD score of 2.78 at theta equal to 0.0 was calculated for the syndrome locus and DXYS1 (pDP34). The more distal Xq loci showed increasing recombination with the syndrome locus. These results are consistent with location for this syndrome near Xq21.31, the chromosomal locus for DXYSI.
