Abstract : Insulin resistance is a common metabolic disorder. It plays an important role in the metabolic syndrome (or syndrome X), type 2 diabetes, obesity and in the lipodystrophic syndromes recently described, associated with treatments of HIV disease and represent a worrying cardiovascular risk. However, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood in these situations. Syndromes of major insulin resistance, although rare, allow investigations of the mechanisms leading to alterations in the insulin transduction pathways. Mutations of the insulin receptor gene have been discovered in rare patients. Therefore alterations at the post-receptor level are probably causative in other cases. Furthermore, the role of body fat repartition seems determinant in the apparition of insulin resistance, as attested by the clinical characteristics of lipodystrophies, either congenital or acquired. The two lipodystrophic syndromes which molecular defect is identified are the familial partial lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type, due to mutations of the lamin A/C gene, and the congenital generalized lipodystrophy, linked to alterations in the protein seipin. However, their physiopathology remains mysterious. Lamin A/C is indeed an ubiquitous nuclear protein, which is also mutated in a genetic squelettic and/or cardiac myopathy, and seipin is a protein of unknown function mainly expressed in brain. Progresses in the understanding of these syndromes, in particular lipodystrophies which can be considered as caricatural models of the metabolic syndrome, will probably allow to clarify the physiopathology of the more common forms of insulin resistance.
