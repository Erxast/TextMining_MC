Title : Ebstein's Anomaly of the Tricuspid Valve: an Overview of Pathology and Management.
Date : 2020
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Ebstein's anomaly (EA) is a rare, but complex form of congenital heart disease consisting of a right ventricular myopathy and morphologic tricuspid valve disease leading to a high incidence of right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. This review offers an updated overview of the current understanding and management of patients with EA with a focus on the adult population.Increased understanding of anatomic accessory atrioventricular pathways in EA has resulted in an improvement in ablation techniques and long-term freedom of atrial arrhythmia recurrence. Despite an improvement in understanding and recognition of EA, significant disease heterogeneity and complex treatment options continue to challenge providers, with the best outcomes achieved at expert congenital heart disease centers.
