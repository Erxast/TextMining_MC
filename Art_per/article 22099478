Abstract : To investigate the effect of increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on the fetal urinary system.Pregnant rabbits (15-day gestation) were used. Control (n = 5) and experimental (EG, n = 4) groups underwent intraperitoneal catheter placement. The IAP was increased by intraperitoneal air insufflations during the third trimester in the EG. At term, organ weight and organ weight/body weight (BW) ratios were noted, histological examination of the urinary system organs was performed, and the apoptotic indexes were calculated.BW and total renal weight were significantly increased in the EG (38.65 ± 8.34 g vs 49.36 ± 8.81 g, p = 0.008; and 0.406 ± 0.132 g vs 0.531 ± 0.129 g, p = 0.02). Total renal weight/BW ratio did not differ between groups (0.0103 ± 0.001 vs 0.0107 ± 0.001; p = 0.33). Bladder weight and bladder weight/BW ratio was also significantly increased in the EG (0.067 ± 0.014 g vs 0.114 ± 0.026 g, p = 0.00; and 0.00175 ± 0.00026 vs 0.00229 ± 0.00036, p = 0.001). Immature glomeruli and collecting tubules, and a thin and underdeveloped muscular layer in the ureter and bladder were encountered in the EG, and the apoptotic cell index was significantly increased (p < 0.05).Increased IAP has an adverse effect on fetal urinary system development, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of various congenital abnormalities of the urinary system.
