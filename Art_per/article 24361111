Abstract : Histological mitochondrial changes are generally found to be associated with late onset myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs). How these changes contribute to the pathogenesis of MFMs is unknown. Mitochondrial changes, including COX-deficient fibers (n = 8), biochemical activities of respiratory chain complexes (n = 7), and multiple mtDNA deletions by long-range PCR (n = 9) were examined in patients with genetically confirmed MFMs [MYOT (n = 2), DES (n = 1), ZASP (n = 2), FLNC (n = 4)] and compared with age and sex matched normal controls (n = 27) and patients with a mitochondrial disorder with multiple mtDNA deletions due to nuclear genetic defects (n = 8). In 2 MFM patients, micro dissected fibers were analyzed for multiple mtDNA deletions by nested long-range PCR. The COX-deficient fibers only partly corresponded with fibers containing myofibrillar accumulations. In total, there was no difference in the percentage of COX-deficient fibers in MFM patients and normal controls. However, the percentage of COX-deficient fibers was significantly higher in 3 MFM patients. Two MFM patients but none of the controls had multiple mtDNA deletions. Nested long-range PCR detected multiple mtDNA deletions only in COX-deficient fibers. Citrate synthase activities in MFM patients were 1.5-fold increased by compared to those in controls, suggesting initiation of mitochondrial alterations. However, it is unclear whether this is a direct consequence of MFM pathology. *both authors contributed equally to the manuscript.
