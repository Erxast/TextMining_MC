Abstract : The etiological theories of vocal fold cysts can be divided into two basic groups: those of congenital and acquired cysts. In ongoing practice, the authors had noted that the greater number of cysts appeared at the functionally most active segment of the vocal folds which, on the other hand, has the least number of glands. Also, it had been noted that patients with vocal fold cysts tended to have hyperkinetic patterns of voice production. These observations indicated the possibility of a functional aspect in the etiology of vocal fold cysts, and consideration of such a possibility was the aim of this work. In 37 cases, the exact location of the cyst was established. In addition, the muscular activity of the phonatory apparatus was estimated, patient self-descriptions with respect to talkativeness were taken into account, and histological evaluations were made. The cysts were most frequently found in the area of the junction of the anterior and middle thirds of the free edge of the vocal fold. Muscular activity during speech and phonation was increased in study patients. Sixty-five percent of patients had epidermoid cysts and 35% had retention cysts of the vocal fold. According to study results, the functional aspect of cyst genesis has a marked role in the etiology of vocal fold cysts, which points to the great importance of functional care for cyst patients.
