Abstract : Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is a genetic disorder of fatty acid beta oxidation that is caused by a defect in ACADVL, which encodes VLCAD. The clinical presentation of VLCAD deficiency is heterogeneous, and either a delayed diagnosis or a misdiagnosis may sometimes occur. We herein describe a difficult-to-diagnose case of the muscle form of adult-onset VLCAD deficiency with compound heterozygous ACADVL mutations including c.790A>G (p.K264E) and c.1246G>A (p.A416T).
