Title : Möbius syndrome and transposition of the great vessels.
Date : 1988
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case of Möbius syndrome was associated with transposition of the aorta and pulmonary artery, as well as acheiria. This combination of anomalies supports the hypothesis that Möbius syndrome is caused by an intrapartum insult during the fourth to seventh week of gestation and is consistent with the vascular theory of embryopathogenesis.
