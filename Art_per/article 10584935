Title : Trigger finger in children.
Date : 1999
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : At the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, 239 trigger digits in 176 children were seen and treated surgically over a 10-year period. Trigger fingers accounted for 33 (14%) of these digits in 18 (10%) of the patients. In 8 of 18 patients (44%) the fingers continued to trigger after A-1 pulley release. In children, trigger fingers are different from trigger thumbs. Trigger fingers in children are uncommon and have variable causes, and an A-1 pulley release alone will not always correct the triggering. Additional treatments, such as resection of one or both limbs of the sublimis tendon or an A-3 pulley release, may be required. An awareness of other contributing factors and readiness to explore the entire flexor mechanism should help prevent failure of surgical treatment.
