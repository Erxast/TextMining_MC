Date : 2003
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A number of idiopathic degenerative diseases affecting the central nervous system, peripheral nerves and muscles of immature and young adult rottweilers are reported. Tetraparesis or ataxia causing abnormalities in gait and posture are clinical findings common to these conditions. The current knowledge about these syndromes is presented in this review, with an emphasis on the clinical characteristics. Knowledge of these syndromes and a methodical approach to neurological diagnosis can help the veterinarian to identify the underlying disease and establish a prognosis when presented with a tetraparetic or ataxic young rottweiler.
