Abstract : Symptomatic macroglossia occurs in some rare congenital muscle diseases, such as Becker's and Duchenne's dystrophies or Pompe's disease. Herein we describe a case of symptomatic macroglossia with myositis of the tongue occurring in a patient with polymyositis. Tongue myositis was evidenced by dysarthria, frequent biting during mastication, swallowing difficulties without aspiration, and noisy breathing. Magnetic resonance imaging showed homogeneous hypertrophy of the tongue, especially the mouth's floor muscles. The diagnosis of tongue myositis was established by electromyography and biopsy. No other cause for the macroglossia was found. Symptoms resolved quickly with corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of symptomatic tongue myositis occurring in the course of polymyositis.
