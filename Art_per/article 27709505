Abstract : Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with mitochondrial alterations. MNGIE is characterized by severe gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, peripheral neuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy. The condition is caused by mutation of the TYMP gene. We studied the clinical and biochemical characteristics of a family with MNGIE. The proband was a 48-year-old male presenting with diarrhea and progressive weight loss. He also had ptosis and exhibited eyeball fixation. His blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed diffuse leukoencephalopathy. Ragged red fibers and cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibers were apparent on muscle biopsy. His vision and ptosis deteriorated significantly during follow-up. Our clinical diagnosis of MNGIE was confirmed by TYMP gene analysis. We discovered a homozygous TYMP c.1193-1216 dup-GGGCGCTGCCGCTGGCGCTGGTGC mutation (a duplication). Some of the family members were heterozygous for the mutation but had no clinical features. We predicted the function of this mutation using PredictProtein and found that the secondary structure had changed in the region of the helix and strand, the transmembrane region, and the protein-protein binding sites. The family described herein exhibited biochemically, genetically, and functionally confirmed MNGIE syndrome.
