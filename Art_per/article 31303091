Abstract : Sengers syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy and lactic acidosis. The causative <i>AGK</i> mutations have been identified with whole exome sequencing.We report on a 9-month-old infant with episodic lactic acidosis who died before a definitive diagnosis could be established. Postmortem genomic autopsy revealed a novel homozygous NM_018238: c.1215dupG; p.Phe406Valfs*4 mutation in <i>AGK</i> (OMIM 610345) confirming the diagnosis of Sengers syndrome.This report provides further evidence that reverse genetics is a useful approach in patients who do not manifest the hallmark features of known and recognizable syndromes.
