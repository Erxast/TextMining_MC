Abstract : Since February 1982, 23 patients with scoliosis were treated by releasing the soft tissues on the concave side and plaster spinal fusion jacket. Of these patients, 13 had congenital scoliosis and 10 idiopathic scoliosis. Follow-up for 1 to 8.5 years showed that the results of correction were satisfactory. The maximum degree of correction of the main curve in this series was from 74 degrees (Cobb method) before treatment to 3 degrees after treatment. The maximum rate of correction was 97.3%.
