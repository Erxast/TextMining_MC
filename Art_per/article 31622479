Title : Delayed Onset of Retinopathy of Prematurity Associated With Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Pearson Syndrome.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a biphasic disease in which the first phase is characterized by high oxygen tension leading to vaso-obliteration in the retina. Pearson syndrome is a rare multisystem mitochondrial disease with a defect in cellular respiration. The authors describe a patient with Pearson syndrome and delayed onset of ROP at a postconceptual age of 42 weeks. The proposed mechanistic theory was the increased oxygen use associated with the metabolic impairments in Pearson syndrome counterbalancing the effects of supplemental oxygen during the vaso-obliterative stage of ROP.
