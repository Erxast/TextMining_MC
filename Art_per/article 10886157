Abstract : Infiltrating lipoma is a rare variety of lipoma, characterized by an infiltration of the adipose tissue of the muscles. Infiltrating lipomas are usually classified in two groups: intermuscular infiltrating lipoma and intramuscular infiltrating lipoma. Most are acquired, and they usually appear in middle-aged individuals. Exceptionally, they are congenital. In such cases they are not related to other diseases. We report an 8-year-old boy with a congenital infiltrating lipoma of the upper limb and von Willebrand disease. Both diseases are linked to an alteration in chromosome 12, but this clinical association seems to be random rather than causal.
