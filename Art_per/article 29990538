Title : Effects of mitochondrial disease/dysfunction on pregnancy: A retrospective study.
Date : 2019
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A retrospective survey assessed the gynecologic, obstetric and fertility history of 103 women with mitochondrial disease (MD)/dysfunction (Md) aged 16 to 75 who had previously been pregnant. Most participants (34%) had a mitochondrial myopathy and there were 248 combined pregnancies with live deliveries (average 3.6 pregnancies/woman). In general, pregnancy in those with MD/Md appears to exacerbate some constitutional and neurological symptoms and may be more frequently associated with common obstetric complications, but this did not appear to result in worse pregnancy outcomes. Most women carried their pregnancy to term, but their neonates tended to have more congenital anomalies than expected.
