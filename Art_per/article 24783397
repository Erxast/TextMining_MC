Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A young male patient was admitted to our hospital with history of dysuria, recurrent vomiting, severe muscle pain and weakness which was induced by a session of rigorous exercise for the first time in the local gymnasium. He was subsequently diagnosed with exercise-induced acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis and managed accordingly. Later on during follow-up he was found to have extreme hypouricaemia (serum uric acid 0.2 mg/dl) and was subsequently diagnosed with renal hypouricaemia. Biochemical investigations on other family members of the patient revealed hereditary renal hypouricaemia in the family.
