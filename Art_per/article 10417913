Abstract : Whether congenital or acquired, unilateral or bilateral, ptosis is due to deficiency of levator muscle of the upper eyelid and comprises one of the most prevalent defects of palpebral pathology.We retrospectively reviewed 1,500 personal cases of ptosis, 890 of them had undergone surgical procedures over the period 1986-1997. We recorded: etiologic factors, the frequency of different forms of ptosis, the associated anomalies, operative techniques and postoperative results.Simple congenital ptosis was the most frequent form. Levator muscle resection was the most largely used operative technique. Minor hypocorrection was often accepted and poor results were found in 22% of the operated cases.
