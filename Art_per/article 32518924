Abstract : To describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of patients with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency.   Methods: A retrospective observational cross-sectional analysis was conducted on all patients with VLCAD deficiency at  (Genetic/Metabolic Section), Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from 2000 to 2019. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted from the electronic hospital records using a case report form. Results: A total of 14 children were analyzed. Six presented with hypoglycemia, 4 with cardiomyopathy, and 10 had rhabdomyolysis. Five patients had early onset severe phenotype, while 9 had mild form. The molecular study revealed homozygous mutations in ACADVL in all 14 patients. Three variants were not reported before. All patients were treated with medium-chain triglyceride and carnitine. Ten patients are alive and have normal development, while 4 died. Conclusion: Most of the patients in this cohort presented in the neonatal period either by newborn screening or clinically with hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, and rhabdomyolysis. The new molecular variants detected in this study broaden the genetic spectrum of VLCAD deficiency in Saudi Arabia.
