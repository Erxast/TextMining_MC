Abstract : Microstomia is defined as an acquired or congenital condition involving a reduction of the oral aperture severe enough to compromise esthetics, nutrition, and quality of life. This clinical report describes a technique for fabricating a mandibular swing-lock complete denture with a hinge for a patient with muscular dystrophy. A hinge in the midline allowed the denture to collapse. The collapsed denture could then be inserted into the mouth and locked into position. A sectional impression technique was used and the custom hinge was designed on the cobalt-chromium metal framework of the complete denture. The protocol presentedÂ can provide a viable treatment option for edentulous patients with microstomia.
