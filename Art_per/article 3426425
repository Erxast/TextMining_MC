Abstract : The authors report the first Fukuyama type congenital progressive muscular dystrophy case described in Brazil, and confirmed through clinical findings and complementary tests. Emphasis is given to the presence of early fibrotendinous retractions and impairment of the central nervous system, which constitute the fundamental characteristics of this affection. This disease is very common in Japan but very seldom described in other countries. Its etiopathogeny has not yet been defined.
