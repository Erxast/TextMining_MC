Abstract : Amish nemaline myopathy (ANM) is a severe congenital form of NM, known to be fatal in early childhood due to pulmonary insufficiency. Homozygous mutation in TNNT1 was originally ascertained in an Older Amish community in 2000. To date, only five reports with six pathogenic variants in TNNT1 have been described in both Amish and non-Amish families. Here, we describe a 16-month old female from a small Mennonite community from Mexico, presenting with congenital hypotonia and dilated cardiomyopathy, with a novel homozygous deletion of 19q13.42 of about 11â€¯kb in size, encompassing TNNT1 and TNNI3. Cardiomyopathy has not been observed in association with ANM in previous reports. Conversely, homozygous mutation in TNNI3 have been described with dilated cardiomyopathy. Our report underscores the consideration of contiguous gene deletion in children with ANM who present with congenital hypotonia and cardiomyopathy. The report also expands the known spectrum of non-Amish related ANM mutations to include homozygous multi-exonic TNNT1 deletion.
