Abstract : The mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of mitochondrial DNA. Patients with this syndrome may present acute onset of sensorineural hearing loss, which is genetic in origin. An impression of the MELAS syndrome is favored because hearing loss is part of the syndrome for some patients with epilepsy. We report a 20-year-old man who suffered from acute onset of bilateral hearing loss with epilepsy and two stroke-like events which recovered without any sequela. Epilepsy with complex partial seizures was controlled by antiepileptic drugs. Brain magnetic resonance images showed high signal lesions in bilateral temporal lobes. Serum levels of pyruvate and lactate were elevated. Muscle biopsy showed ragged-red fibers and molecular genetic study showed a point mutation of the mitochondrial A3243G gene. Mitochondrial disease with the MELAS syndrome was diagnosed and then he was treated with Co-enzyme Q10 and carnitine. The symptoms recovered gradually.
