Title : [Steindler-plasty in paralysis of the elbow flexor muscles].
Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In 1918, Steindler described an operation technique in which the origins of the wrist flexors are displaced proximally from the ulnar epicondyle. In this way, these muscles attain a usable flexor function at the elbow joint. In the last seven years, we have carried out this surgical technique in nine patients. These comprised patients with incomplete upper arm plexus paresis, poliomyelitis and congenital multiple arthrogryposis. The active flexor function of the elbow joint differed in strength but always led to a marked improvement in use of the affected limb. The biomechanical problems of this surgical technique are commented on.
