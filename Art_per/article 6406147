Date : 1983
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Computed tomography has added another dimension to the evaluation of musculoskeletal disease. The ability to discern subtle differences in tissue densities and the capability of viewing structures in the axial plane has greatly aided the resolution between normal and pathologic tissue and the appreciation of the anatomic relation between normal and pathologic structures. This paper deals with the application of CT in the evaluation of neoplastic, inflammatory, traumatic, metabolic, and congenital diseases of the musculoskeletal system.
