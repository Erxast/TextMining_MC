Title : Dystrophin and nebulin in the muscular dystrophies.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Skeletal muscle from patients with 5 different forms of muscular dystrophy and from 6 fetuses at high risk (95%) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) were probed with specific antibodies for the presence of dystrophin and nebulin. Dystrophin was absent in all 5 patients with DMD and 4 of 6 fetuses at high risk for DMD and present in trace amounts in the remaining two. Dystrophin was also undetectable in one borderline DMD/Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) case and reduced in 2 of 4 cases of BMD. In contrast, dystrophin was present in all 16 biopsies from 4 other types of muscular dystrophy (congenital, limb girdle, Emery-Dreifuss and facioscapulohumeral). Nebulin profiles varied with the type, severity and duration of the dystrophic process. Nebulin was present in 5 of 6 DMD fetal samples but vastly reduced or absent in all samples of clinically manifest DMD.
