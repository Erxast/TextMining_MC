Abstract : Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) associated with pathogenic variants in the DOK7 gene (DOK7-CMS) have phenotypic overlap with other neuromuscular disorders associated with limb-girdle muscular weakness (LGMW). Genetic analysis of the most common mutation (c.1124_1127dupTGCC) in DOK7 was performed in 34 patients with "unexplained" LGMW associated with non-specific changes in muscle biopsy. Of the 34 patients, one patient showed the DOK7 c.1124_1127dupTGCC variant in homozygousity. Our study estimates the minimum prevalence of undiagnosed DOK7-CMS to be 2.9% in southern Brazilian patients from our centre. Our data confirm that clinicians should look for DOK7-CMS patients when the clinical manifestation is an 'unexplained' LGMW, mainly if associated with non-specific changes in muscle biopsy.
