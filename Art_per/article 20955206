Date : 2011
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 5-year-old boy was referred to our neurology clinic for suspected myopathy. His parents reported normal upper extremity strength and no limitation in daily activities; however, he was unable to raise his arms above his head. On examination, both shoulders were down-slanting and anteriorly displaced, leading to a webbed neck appearance. Muscle MRI demonstrated isolated bilateral aplasia of the trapezius muscles. His father was found to have a unilateral partial trapezius hypoplasia with no functional consequences.Congenital aplasia of the trapezius muscle is a rare condition; bilateral aplasia of the muscle, having been reported in only five cases, is most often associated with aplasia of the pectoralis major. This is the first report to our knowledge to demonstrate bilateral isolated trapezius aplasia by MRI.
