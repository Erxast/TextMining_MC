Abstract : Neuromuscular disorders in small animals include a diverse group of congenital and acquired diseases. The prognosis will vary according to the disorder and the portion of the motor unit affected. A number of diseases might be satisfactorily treated (for example, myasthenia gravis, congenital myotonia), whereas others may be self-limiting (for example, hereditary myopathy of Labrador Retrievers). Accurate diagnosis is necessary for establishing a prognosis and treatment plan suitable to the patient and client. Specific diagnosis in the absence of specialized tests is difficult, although not always impossible (for example, congenital myotonia in the Chow Chow). A knowledge of the neuromuscular diseases that might affect small animals, a detailed history, and a thorough physical examination will help in the presumptive diagnosis. Specialized laboratory examinations may need to be applied (for example, antiacetylcholine receptor antibody titer for acquired myasthenia gravis). Referral may be necessary for more detailed diagnostic workup (for example, electromyographic examination, nerve or muscle biopsy examination). In the case of inherited neuromuscular disorders, a knowledge of inheritance patterns will allow genetic counseling to avoid future problem breedings.
