Abstract : Data on muscular dystrophies (MDs), a heterogeneous group of heritable diseases hallmarked by progressive muscle deterioration, are scarce.We describe cross-sectional sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of individuals with congenital, distal, Emery-Dreifuss, facioscapulohumeral, limb-girdle, myotonic, or oculopharyngeal MD.The study was conducted in four sites (Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, and 12 western New York counties) as a pilot expansion of the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking and Research Network, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MDs were detected in healthcare facilities and administrative data sources using International Classification of Disease codes. Our sample contains 1,723 individuals with a MD diagnosis and a healthcare encounter between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2011.Individuals were mostly non-Hispanic and white. Median ages ranged from 9.2 to 66.0 years. Most (98%) had health insurance. The proportion of individuals who were disabled or unable to work increased with age (range: 8.6-46.4%). People with limb-girdle MD aged ≥18 years were more likely to be nonambulatory (range: 24.5-44.7%). The percentages of individuals with documented clinical interventions during the surveillance period were low. The most common cause of death was respiratory causes (46.3-57.1%); an ICD-10 code for MD (G71.1 or G71.0) was reported for nearly one-half. Our findings show wide variability in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics across MDs.
