Abstract : The radial forearm flap is used extensively in hand and reconstructive surgery. We have performed 31 radial forearm flaps (15 free and 16 pedicled flaps) in 25 adults and 5 children. This series was analyzed in an attempt to minimize the sequelae of the upper limb and provide more specific indications for this flap. Vascular sequelae were assessed by Doppler and thermography examinations. The functional sequelae were appreciated by wrist motion and grasp strength examinations. Cutaneous sequelae were evaluated according to the time of healing and the quality of the scars. Several technical modifications may be proposed in order to try to minimize sequelae. As shown by our study, cutaneous sequelae are the most important and they must always be considered in the indication of this flap.
