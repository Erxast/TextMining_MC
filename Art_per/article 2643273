Abstract : Arthrogryposis (multiple congenital contractures) has various causes and appears as many different syndromes. The basic classification for therapeutic and prognostic purposes divides affected children into those who have only limb involvement, those with limb and trunk, craniofacial or visceral involvement, and those with severe central nervous system dysfunction. Decreased fetal movement is an important etiologic factor. A multidisciplinary approach is required to evaluate these children, and early physical therapy is essential.
