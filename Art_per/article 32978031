Abstract : Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Next generation sequencing has been increasingly used for molecular diagnosis in CMS patients. This study aimed to identify the disease-causing variants in Thai patients. We recruited patients with a diagnosis of CMS based on clinical and electrophysiologic findings, and whole exome sequencing was performed. Thirteen patients aged from 2 to 54 years (median: 8 years) from 12 families were enrolled. Variants were identified in 9 of 13 patients (69%). Five novel variants and two previously reported variant were found in the COLQ, RAPSN and CHRND gene. The previously reported c.393+1G>A splice site variant in the COLQ gene was found in a majority of patients. Five patients harbor the homozygous splice site c.393+1G>A variant, and two patients carry compound heterozygous c.393+1G>A, c.718-1G>T, and c.393+1G>A, c.865G>T (p.Gly289Ter) variants. The novel variants were also found in RAPSN (p.Cys251del, p.Arg282Cys) and CHRND (p.Met481del). Molecular diagnosis in CMS patients can guide treatment decisions and may be life changing, especially in patients with COLQ mutations.
