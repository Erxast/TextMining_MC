Abstract : Muscular hernias represent focal muscular protrusions through an acquired or congenital fascial defect. The anterior tibialis muscle is most frequently affected. The ultrasound (US) findings in a pediatric patient with bilateral anterior tibialis muscle herniation are presented. US examination performed following exercise enhanced sonographic visualization of the fascial defect and the associated muscular herniation.
