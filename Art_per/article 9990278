Abstract : Fibromatosis colli, a common cause of congenital muscular torticollis, should be differentiated from other neck masses in infants. Invasive diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be avoided.Three infants under the age of 2 months presented with neck masses--a clinical suspicion of malignancy, lymphadenopathy and teratoma. The cytologic findings included dyshesive multinucleated skeletal muscle fragments showing degenerative and atrophic changes within a background of scattered reactive fibroblasts.Fine needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and rapid method of providing a confirmatory diagnosis of neck masses in infants.
