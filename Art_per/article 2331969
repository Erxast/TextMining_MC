Abstract : The Arthromyodysplasia congenita hereditaria is marked by the flexion and fixation of the front leg joints. The statistic analysis of all available data from 536 calves showed that male calves and twins are significantly more affected. The course, duration and delivery date in the pregnancy of cows with arthromyodysplastic calves showed no peculiarity. Concomitant defects of arthromyodysplasia of the forelimbs were spine- and heart defects and neuromyodysplasia of the hind legs. Three bulls KUR, KER and ALD were ancestors of 37% of all registered calves. This frequency of arthromyodysplasia in the bloodline of these three bulls seem to be a sign for a genetic factor with a strong penetrance in male calves.
