Abstract : The involvement of the upper limb in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita for many patients means a far-reaching dependency on outside help. The extension contracture of the elbow joint especially makes it impossible to reach the mouth or to perform hygienic necessities. Therefore, the rehabilitation program includes an improvement of passive elbow flexion by capsulotomy or of active flexion by triceps transfer if possible, or both. In bilateral involvement, the optimal solution is to have one arm in flexion for reaching the head and mouth passively or even actively and one arm in extension for hygienic necessities. From 1973 to 1993 we performed 22 releases of the elbow contracture in 16 children. An additional triceps transfer was performed in five elbows. The overall results showed a marked increase of the range of motion and a functional improvement concerning the daily activities (in 17 children). In 5 children there was no gain but also no loss of functional capacities. In 3 of 5 children with an additional triceps transfer, an improvement of active flexion was attained. Pre- and postoperative physiotherapy is at least as important as the operative procedure itself.
