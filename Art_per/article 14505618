Abstract : Temporalis myofascial flap holds great promise for the reconstruction of various defects of the maxillofacial region-either congenital or surgical. The dependable blood supply through the middle and deep temporal arteries, proximity to the maxillofacial region, possibility to mobilize it to the oral cavity through the under surface of zygomatic arch and its fanned out nature permits the surgeon to use this flap for the reconstruction of various maxillofacial defects and even as an interposing tissue. In this series of 30 cases, we have used the temporalis myofascial flap for the reconstruction of different types of maxillofacial defects and as an interposing material in TMJ surgeries. We found that this flap is very valuable in maxillofacial reconstruction.
