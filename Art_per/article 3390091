Abstract : A syndrome of congenital malformations in Corriedale sheep characterised by brachygnathia inferior, campylognathia, tetraemlic arthrogryposis, kyphoscoliosis, hydranencephaly and hypoplasia of the brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord occurring in various combinations is described. Histologically there was generalised hypomyelinogenesis and hypoplasia of the central nervous system with neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle. The syndrome resembled that caused by congenital infection with Akabane virus, however, serological, pathological and epidemiological data indicated that Akabane virus was not involved. The results of a breeding trial suggested that the disorder may be transmitted with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.
