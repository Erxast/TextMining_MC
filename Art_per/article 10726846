Abstract : X-Linked myotubular myopathy is a well delineated congenital myopathy, with a high neonatal and early childhood mortality. Only a single gene, mapping to Xq28 has been implicated and has recently been characterized. Phenotypic variability, both inter- and intrafamilial, has been recorded. Its severest expression is a uniform disease with polyhydramnios due to prenatal (neuromuscular) swallowing disorder, and partial inability to expand the lungs postnatally leading to early postnatal death in all. The mildest expression appears to be represented by the first family reported in the literature in which intrafamilial phenotypic variability was marked. There was neonatal asphyxia, but recovery took place in most affected patients and very mild expression permitting normal life into adulthood has been found in two patients. A long-term follow-up is given on both these families. Results emphasize the importance of the family history when trying to prognosticate in an individual case.
