Title : Dynamin 2 the rescue for centronuclear myopathy.

Abstract : Centronuclear myopathy is a lethal muscle disease. The most severe form of the disease, X-linked centronuclear myopathy, is due to mutations in the gene encoding myotubularin (MTM1), while mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) and amphiphysin 2/BIN1 (AMPH2) cause milder forms of myopathy. MTM1 is a lipid phosphatase, and mutations that disrupt this activity cause severe muscle wasting. In this issue of the JCI, Cowling and colleagues report on their finding of increased DNM2 levels in human and mouse muscle with MTM1 mutations. Partial reduction of Dnm2 in mice harboring Mtm1 mutations remarkably rescued muscle wasting and lethality, and this effect was muscle specific. DNM2 regulates membrane trafficking through vesicular scission, and it is presumed that reducing this activity accounts for improved outcome in X-linked centronuclear myopathy.
