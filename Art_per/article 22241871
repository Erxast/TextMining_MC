Abstract : Congenital infiltrating lipomatosis of the face (CIL-F) is a rare lipomatous lesion with diffuse fatty infiltration of tissues and hyperplasia of underlying bone. We report clinical and CT findings in an unusual case of CIL-F presenting with progressive hemifacial asymmetry, manifesting as severely restricted mouth opening owing to exophytic temporomandibular joint ankylosis. The role of imaging in diagnosis is presented with a review of the literature. Differential diagnosis of CIL-F and its exclusion as a cause of hemifacial hyperplasia are also discussed.
