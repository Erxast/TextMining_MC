Abstract : Arthrogryposis is a rare condition characterised by multiple congenital joint contractures. We present a case of a 10-year-old child with arthrogryposis and snoring. Polysomnography revealed significant obstructive sleep apnoea and hypoventilation that improved but did not completely resolve with adenotonsillectomy. With continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, there was full resolution of all sleep disordered breathing. Initially, the patient admitted to difficulty tolerating nasal CPAP at home. However, she steadily improved adherence to therapy and admitted that with nasal CPAP use for the whole night, she felt more energised during the daytime.
