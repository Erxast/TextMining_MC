Title : Bipartite trapezium with adduction contracture of the thumb: a case report.
Date : 1979 Nov-Dec
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This is a case report on bipartite trapezium in a 12-year-old girl that presented as a painless protrusion at the base of the first metacarpal bone associated with an adduction contracture of the thumb. This seems to be the first such case to have been reported in an adolescent. The condition bears no resemblance to the numerous descriptions in the literature on accessory bones about the trapezium.
