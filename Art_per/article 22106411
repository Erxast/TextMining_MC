Abstract : Protein tyrosine phosphatase-like A (PTPLa) has been implicated in skeletal myogenesis and cardiogenesis. Mutations in PTPLa correlated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in humans and congenital centronuclear myopathy with severe hypotonia in dogs. The molecular mechanisms of PTPLa in myogenesis are unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that PTPLa is required for myoblast growth and differentiation. The cells lacking PTPLa remained immature and failed to differentiate into mature myotubes. The repressed MyoG expression was responsible for the impaired myoblast differentiation. Meanwhile, impeded cell growth, with an obvious S-phase arrest and compromised G(2)/M transition, was observed in PTPLa-deficient myoblasts. Further study demonstrated that the upregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E2 complexes, along with a compromised G(2)/M transition due to the decreased CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) activity and upregulated p21, contributed to the mutant cell S-phase arrest and eventually led to the retarded cell growth. Finally, the transcriptional regulation of the PTPLa gene was explored. We identified PTPLa as a new target gene of the serum response factor (SRF). Skeletal- and cardiac-muscle-specific SRF knockouts resulted in significant decreases in PTPLa expression, suggesting a conserved transcriptional regulation of the PTPLa gene in mice.
