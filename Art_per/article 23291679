Abstract : 11β hydroxylase deficiency (OHD) is one of the main causes of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. There have been only a few reported cases of nonclassic 11β OHD, a milder form of the disease. It is difficult to detect occult nonclassic 11β OHD because patients present with no or mild symptoms. We herein present a case of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) with Graves' disease leading to the discovery of a hidden nonclassic 11β OHD. In this case, increased levels of thyroid hormone seem to have induced symptoms of occult nonclassic 11β OHD and aggravated TPP.
