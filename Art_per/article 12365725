Abstract : Myofibrillar or desmin-related myopathies encompass neuromuscular disorders with abnormal deposits of desmin and myofibrillar alterations. We report 3 unrelated patients presenting with proximal and distal myopathy, and, as a unique congenital syndrome, diffusely distributed myopathy, osteoporosis and myopia. Muscle biopsies shared cytoplasmic inclusions, rimmed vacuoles, and ragged-red-like fibers. Sarcoplasmic inclusions, either plaque-like or amorphous, strongly immunoreacted on dystrophin and variably for desmin, alphaB crystallin and ubiquitin. Cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1, CDK2 and CDK5 were overexpressed in affected fibers. Ultrastructurally, focal myofibrillar disruption was accompanied by tubulo-filamentous inclusions in one case and abundant glycogen and enlarged mitochondria displaying respiratory chain dysfunction at biochemistry in another case. Molecular analysis of the alphaB crystallin gene coding sequence and exons 4, 5 and 6 of the desmin gene did not reveal any mutation. The morphologic denominator of hyaline structures and areas of myofibrillar destruction occurs in heterogeneous conditions and may overlap with features of inclusion body myopathy and mitochondrial myopathy.
