Abstract : The paper concerns a family in which father and sibs (two brothers and a sister) suffered from rapid-progressing myodystrophy. Clinically, the disease was marked by a debut in the pubertal period (at 12 to 13 years), derangement of the muscles of the limb girdles, proximal parts of the legs and arms, and distal parts of the legs. The given case was also characterized by the impairment of the cervical and facial muscles as well as by associated neuromuscular lesions and neurosensory hypoacusis. The case described supports the clinical pleomorphism of the facial scapulohumeral form of Landouzy-Dejerine myopathy.
