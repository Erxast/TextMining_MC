Abstract :   Neuromuscular disorders can be the cause of sudden death of infants because of their weakness and gastroesophageal reflux (GER).  Muscle biopsy and genetic studies were performed by usual method.  In this report four cases of infants with neuromuscular disorders (two cases of congenital myopathy and two cases of spinal muscular atrophy) who had unexpected cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival (CPAOA) are presented. Two of the cases did not show any symptoms, such as muscle weakness prior to CPAOA. The diagnosis was based on the results of the muscle biopsy and genetic examination.  These results suggest that sudden infant death caused by neuromuscular disorders should be considered.
