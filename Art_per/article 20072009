Abstract : Melnick-Needles syndrome is a congenital syndrome associated with severe architectural disorder of the skeletal system that can cause significant effects on the craniofacial skeleton including the mandible and temporomandibular joint. We report on a case of a young adult patient who experienced chronic dislocation, pain, and dysfunction of her temporomandibular joints related to both a severe bite dysfunction (mandibular hypoplasia) and the underlying bony architectural disorder associated with Melnick-Needles syndrome. The patient underwent bilateral mandibular distraction to correct her skeletal malocclusion and improve the condylar relationship with the temporomandibular joint fossae. The inherent bony abnormalities presented unique challenges to distraction. The patient was successfully distracted using internal mandibular distractors, rhBMP-2, and a prolonged distraction protocol. The patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms and resumed an unrestricted diet 6 months after removal of devices and has been pain-free for more than 24 months.
