Abstract : Ventricular aneurysms have rarely been reported prenatally. Their prognosis is variable depending on factors such as early detection, their relative size in comparison to the ventricular cavity, growth on follow-up, and signs of cardiac failure. In view of the fact that it may be useful to report on additional cases in order to make available further information on aetiology, prognosis and neonatal management, we hereby report on two cases of ventricular aneurysm with good mid-term prognosis. One case of apical aneurysm of the left ventricle was associated with a muscular ventricular septal defect, the features of which are compatible with a fetal myocardial infarction and ventricular septal rupture in absence of coronary artery anomalies as demonstrated by catheterisation. Another case of sub-tricuspidal aneurysm of the right ventricle associated with mitral prolapse appears to be a component of diffuse connective dysplasia. Despite the early gestational age at diagnosis, the large size of the aneurysm and the associated defect, both the infants were asymptomatic in infancy prompting a conservative management.
