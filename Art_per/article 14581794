Abstract : Only a few reports of nonsyndromic paucity of interlobular bile ducts (NS-PILBD) have been published. The authors' aim was to outline the clinical and laboratory profile of patients with NS-PILBD diagnosed at a tertiary referral center.The authors reviewed all the reports of pediatric liver biopsies performed between 1991 and 2000 at their institution. Upon diagnosis of NS-PILBD, patients' records were examined for clinical, laboratory, and histologic data, and liver biopsy specimens were re-evaluated.Three hundred biopsies were performed in children during the study period, of which 64 were in infants younger than 1 year. NS-PILBD was diagnosed in 10 of 64 (16%) biopsy specimens. Mean age at presentation was 10 days (range, 1 day-6 weeks), and mean follow-up was 4.5 years (range, 1-9 years). An underlying condition was identified in 70% of children with NS-PILBD: namely congenital cytomegalovirus (n = 2), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC, n = 2), mitochondrial DNA depletion (n = 1), Niemann-Pick type C (n = 1), and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis (ARC syndrome; n = 1). All children presented with jaundice. Four children had initially acholic stools. At their last follow-up visit, failure to thrive was present in five children, and cholestasis in six children. Mortality was noted only in children with metabolic diseases (n = 2).In the study, NS-PILBD was common in young children undergoing liver biopsy. Although NS-PILBD is nonspecific, a wide survey for inborn errors of metabolism should be included in the diagnostic work-up of NS-PILBD. In the authors' center, the association of certain metabolic diseases with NS-PILBD carries a grave prognosis.
