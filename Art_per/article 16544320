Title : Cognitive impairment in neuromuscular disorders.
Date : 2006
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Several studies have suggested the presence of central nervous system involvement manifesting as cognitive impairment in diseases traditionally confined to the peripheral nervous system. The aim of this review is to highlight the character of clinical, genetic, neurofunctional, cognitive, and psychiatric deficits in neuromuscular disorders. A high correlation between cognitive features and cerebral protein expression or function is evident in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy (Steinert disease), and mitochondrial encephalomyopathies; direct correlation between tissue-specific protein expression and cognitive deficits is still elusive in certain neuromuscular disorders presenting with or without a cerebral abnormality, such as congenital muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, adult polyglucosan body disease, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. No clear cognitive deficits have been found in spinal muscular atrophy and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy.
