Abstract : Central core disease (CCD) is a congenital myopathy linked to mutations in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1), the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel of skeletal muscle. CCD is characterized by formation of amorphous <i>cores</i> within muscle fibers, lacking mitochondrial activity. In skeletal muscle of RYR1<sup>Y522S/WT</sup> knock-in mice, carrying a human mutation in RYR1 linked to malignant hyperthermia (MH) with <i>cores</i>, oxidative stress is elevated and fibers present severe mitochondrial damage and <i>cores</i>. We treated RYR1<sup>Y522S/WT</sup> mice with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant provided <i>ad libitum</i> in drinking water for either 2 or 6 months. Our results show that 2 months of NAC treatment starting at 2 months of age, when mitochondrial and fiber damage was still minimal, (i) reduce formation of <i>unstructured</i> and <i>contracture cores</i>, (ii) improve muscle function, and (iii) decrease mitochondrial damage. The beneficial effect of NAC treatment is also evident following 6 months of treatment starting at 4 months of age, when structural damage was at an advanced stage. NAC exerts its protective effect likely by lowering oxidative stress, as supported by the reduction of 3-NT and SOD2 levels. This work suggests that NAC administration is beneficial to prevent mitochondrial damage and formation of <i>cores</i> and improve muscle function in RYR1<sup>Y522S/WT</sup> mice.
