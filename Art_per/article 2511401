Abstract : Six patients affected by arthrogriposis multiplex congenita (AMC) are studied and the detected alterations, the adopted treatment and the obtained results are described and discussed. Notwithstanding the limited number of considered cases, it is underlined that a precocious, constant and protracted treatment can considerably help these patients to gain a certain degree of self-sufficiency though it can not heal serious deformations. This result is also supported by the cases published by the literature.
