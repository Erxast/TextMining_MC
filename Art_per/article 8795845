Abstract : The spectacular progress concerning dystrophin and its pathology, the dystrophinopathies, has led to a somewhat arbitrarily separated heterogeneous group of nondystrophinopathic muscular dystrophies that currently comprise the Emery-Dreifuss type, the nosologically heterogeneous autosomal-recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, the severe childhood autosomal-recessive muscular dystrophy, the merosin-positive and -negative congenital muscular dystrophies, the autosomal-recessive distal muscular dystrophy of Miyoshi, the facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy, both the adult and neonatal variants. Deficiencies of adhalin in a particular form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and of merosin in a particular form of congenital muscular dystrophy as well as the newly discovered principle of abnormal tri-nucleotide repeats in myotonic dystrophy are evidence of progress that has also amplified the notion of the dystrophinopathies that the protein-deficient muscular dystrophies can now be considered examples of contributions of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex across the muscle fiber plasma membrane.
