Title : The burden of genetic disorders in India and a framework for community control.

Abstract : With a very large population and high birth rate, and consanguineous marriage favoured in many communities, there is a high prevalence of genetic disorders in India. An estimated 495,000 infants with congenital malformations, 390,000 with G6PD deficiency, 21,400 with Down syndrome, 9,000 with beta-thalassaemia, 5,200 with sickle cell disease, and 9,760 with amino acid disorders are born each year. The prevalence of late-onset multi-factorial disorders (including coronary artery disease, hypertension and psychiatric disorders) is also large. Due to inadequate diagnostic, management and rehabilitation facilities, the burden of these disorders is greater than in Western countries. Although genetic diseases receive little attention from the health services, research funding by the government has been liberal. Community control of common disorders like thalassaemia, Down syndrome, neural tube defects, and muscular dystrophies deserves high priority, and genetic services should be integrated into the existing primary health care and medical services. Most genetic counselling would have to be provided through training physicians who staff the district and medical school hospitals. To ensure future progress, there is a need to establish additional departments of medical genetics in medical schools.
