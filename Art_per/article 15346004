Abstract : A 7-year prospective follow-up report, which was previously presented in this journal as an initial pediatric case report, is presented as an approach to management of congenital trismus secondary to masseteric fibrous bands. Adams and Rees discussed management, including endoscopic exploration at 18 months of age with early recurrence of trismus. Under the care of the same plastic surgeon and his team, the progress of this patient over 7 years has given us an insight into management. The cause of trismus is not fully elucidated, but the condition can result in compromised caloric intake, speech development, facial appearance, dental care, and oral hygiene. The decreased oral opening may be secondary to shortening of the muscles of mastication, which may cause tension moulding and distortion of the coronoid process; yet, there is no consensus on the optimal management of temporomandibular joint trismus and all its causes. The patient presented in this report, now aged 7 years, has proceeded through to open surgery on two occasions yet, regrettably, has persistently tight masseter muscles and only 8 mm of jaw opening.
