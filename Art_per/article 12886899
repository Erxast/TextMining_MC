Date : 2003
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We describe a 17-year-old boy with congenital spherocytosis and iron overload who presented with compartment syndrome of the calf as the initial manifestation of Vibrio vulnificus infection after minor trauma in a contaminated fish pond. The disease was complicated by necrotizing fasciitis requiring above the knee amputation. Childhood diseases associated with iron overload pose an increased risk for complicated V. vulnificus infections.
