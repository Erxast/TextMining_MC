Title : Walker-Warburg syndrome in a Japanese patient.
Date : 1988 Jul-Aug
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report the first Japanese female patient with Walker-Warburg syndrome. She had generalized muscle hypotonia with hydrocephalus due to Dandy-Walker malformation and bilateral microphthalmia with opaque corneas. She had severe motor and mental retardation. Muscle histology reflected advanced changes of muscular dystrophy. We discuss the relationship between Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy and Walker-Warburg syndrome, both of which fall within a spectrum of developmental abnormalities with a common cause. In Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, ocular abnormalities are less severe.
