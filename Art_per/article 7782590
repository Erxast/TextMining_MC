Abstract : Steinert's disease or myotonic dystrophy is a heredo-degenerative neuroendocrinal dystrophy. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. The arising of a congenital myotonic dystrophy of one of the new-born children of the maternity hospital enabled to diagnose the Steinert's disease of his mother. A review of the international literature enabled us to recall its interactions with pregnancy. There is an aggravation of myotonia and multiple obstetric complications such as miscarriage, premature onset of labor, polyhydramnios, stillbirth, difficulties during the evacuation, atonic postpartum hemorrhage, anesthetic-accidents. The congenital variant of myotonic dystrophy (6 to 30% of the cases) is a severe disease with a high mortality. It is only seen in the offspring of mothers who themselves have myotonic dystrophy. The myotonic dystrophy gene has been isolated and the mutation-causing myotonic dystrophy was found to result from a series of trinucleotide (CTG) repeats located in the 3' untranslated region of the gene. The direct diagnosis is henceforth possible both on the fetus and parents. Steinert's disease and its association with pregnancy are rare, especially when the affected parent has hypogonadism. The diagnosis of the congenital form is difficult because of the mother is unaware of the disorder. Family and personal history may give hints: hydramnios, appearance delay and reduced fetal movements, and the association at birth of generalized hypotonia with neonatal respiratory distress.
