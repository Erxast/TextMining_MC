Abstract : Foot deformities associated with congenital myopathy are rarely treated surgically; therefore, few reports are available. We present cases of three patients who underwent surgery for foot deformities caused by congenital myopathy. Posteromedial release without talocalcaneal joint release is our surgical procedure. Surgical procedures in each case were determined on the basis of radiographic findings. Surgery resulted in plantigrade feet in the three patients, all of whom were able to walk without pain more than 3 years postoperatively.
