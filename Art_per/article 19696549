Abstract : Duplication is a rare congenital abnormality and may occur in any region of the gastrointestinal tract. A 19-year-old woman was admitted due to lower abdominal pain. Abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed a cystic mass interpreted as mesenteric cyst or duplication cyst. On the operation finding, it seemed to be arised from mesentery but attached to the ileum. Microscopically, the cystic wall was lined by non-keratinizing squamous, ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and ectopic gastric mucosa with two distinct muscular layers and a serosa. We report the first case of ileal duplication cyst lined by squamous and ciliated columnar epithelium in Korea.
