Abstract : An unique myopathy described by Ullrich in 1930 was reported in a 4-year-old Japanese boy. Major clinical findings included proximal joint contracture, muscle hypotonia, prominent calcaneus, high-arched palate, and normal intelli gence. Muscle biopsy showed rather small muscle fivers with variations in size and proliferation of connective tissue. A review of 15 cases in the literature revealed this type of myopathy as a distinctive entity to be classified as a myopathic arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, rather than in the group of muscular dystrophies.
