Date : 2002
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Pediatric stroke has received special attention in the recent literature. It is now recognized as an important cause of mortality and morbidity in pediatric population. Varied and poorly specific symptomatology as well as overlapping risk factors makes the diagnosis of stroke in childhood challenging. Therapy remains controversial. The use of anticoagulation and thrombolysis in the management of acute stroke in children has not been systematically studied. In this article, we discuss the natural history, investigation, and treatment of pediatric arterial hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes.
