Abstract : Accurate and fast measurement of muscle fibre size and evaluation of fibre type proportions in large cross-sectional areas remains challenging as existing methods require extensive manual measurements. In this study, we assessed the fibre morphometry of approximately 1000 fibres in mouse and human control and diseased muscle cross-sections. We compared fibre size, percentage fibre proportion and percentage fibre surface area results obtained by an automated method using MetaMorph with those obtained manually using Image Pro. Data collection using MetaMorph software was faster and produced similar results to those obtained using Image Pro. The ability to quickly and accurately measure large numbers of fibres with MetaMorph allows the researcher to make a more precise assessment of fibre type and fibre size changes in human muscle biopsies and animal models of muscle disease.
