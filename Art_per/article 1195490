Abstract : In September, 1973, a live male 2-3 day old white-tailed deer (Odocoileur virginianus) with multiple anomalies of the head and forelimbs was found near Lethbridge, Alberta. Notable gross findings inculded brachygnathia inferior, atypical incisor tooth alignment, medially folded ears, humero-radial arthrogryposis and bowing of the radius and ulna. Hematologic determinations indicated increased erythrocyte, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Histopathologic examination revealed mineralized spherites in the cerebellum and midbrain.
