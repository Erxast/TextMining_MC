Title : Idiopathic contracture of the gluteus maximus muscle in children.
Date : 1988
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Restriction of motion of the hip caused by contracture of the gluteus maximus is not uncommon. Twenty-seven children with this disorder were reviewed between 1975 and 1983. The clinical manifestations are very characteristic. All patients underwent surgical release of the fibrotic contracture tissue of the gluteus maximus with good results. The etiology of the disorder remains unknown. It is likely that the primary cause might be congenital in origin and that some predisposing condition exists. In addition, intramuscular injection might play an important role.
