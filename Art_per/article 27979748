Abstract : Little is known about how transition readiness relates to other developmental skills of adolescence in youth with chronic illness. Better understanding of how transition readiness relates to these other developmental skills could lead to a broader array of tools to improve transition readiness. Intentional self-regulation (ISR) and hopeful future expectations (HFE) are 2 developmental skills of adolescence that improve with participation in developmental programming and thus are modifiable.We explored associations between transition readiness, as measured by the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire 29 (TRAQ-29) and ISR and HFE in youth with chronic illness recruited from a variety of subspecialty clinics from a major southeast medical center.A total of 71 adolescents with chronic illness were included in the analysis. The TRAQ-29 Self-Advocacy domain showed positive associations to both ISR (P = .03) and HFE (P = .009). In addition, the TRAQ-29 overall had positive associations to HFE (P = .04).The significant associations between TRAQ-29 Self-Advocacy domain scores and ISR and HFE suggest that transition readiness is developing within the context of other developmental areas in adolescence. More work is needed to see if the programming that improves these other developmental skills might also improve transition readiness.
