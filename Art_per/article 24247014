Abstract : The purpose of this focused review is to provide an overview of neuromuscular scoliosis from the perspective of the rehabilitation physician. Scoliosis is a common consequence of neuromuscular diseases, including central nervous system disorders such as cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury; motor neuron disorders, for example, spinal muscular atrophy; muscle fiber disorders, for example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; multifactorial disorders, for example, spina bifida; and many other neuropathic and myopathic conditions. Unlike adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, which is the most common form of spinal deformity, neuromuscular scoliosis is more severe and more progressive, and is associated with more morbidity. Factors that contribute to this spinal deformity include asymmetric paraplegia, imbalance of mechanical forces, intraspinal and congenital anomalies of the spine, altered sensory feedback, and abnormal posture via central pathways. Spinal deformity combined with limitations due to an underlying neuromuscular condition lead to significant physiologic impairments that affect limb movement, cardiopulmonary function, gait, standing, sitting, balance, trunk stability, bimanual activities, activities of daily living, and pain, as well as concerns with self-image and social interactions. Evaluation and management of this population requires understanding of disease progression, pulmonary status, functional limitations, indications for conservative and surgical interventions, and social considerations.
