Abstract : A boy with nonreducible bilateral congenital talipes equinovarus had delayed milestones with early-onset generalized hypotonia and muscular weakness. The condition remained stable until he was 8 years old. A slow worsening of motor abilities, with myopathic signs, was observed thereafter. A homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric (SMN1) gene was found, without neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene deletion, leading to the diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy. Independent ambulation was lost when he was 13 years old. The occurrence of congenital clubfoot with early onset of neurologic signs, but with a very slowly progressive course, has not been reported in spinal muscular atrophy until now.
