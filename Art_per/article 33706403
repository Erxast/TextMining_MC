Abstract : 窶サhe diagnostic workup in patients with delayed motor milestones suspected of having either myopathy or a congenital myasthenic syndrome is complex. Our hypothesis was that performance of a muscle biopsy and neurophysiology including stimulated single-fiber electromyography during an anesthetic procedure, combined with genetic testing has a high diagnostic quality.窶イlinical and paraclinical data were retrospectively collected from 24 patients aged from 1 month to 10 years (median: 5.2 years).窶クeurophysiology examination was performed in all patients and was abnormal in 11 of 24. No patients had findings suggestive of a myasthenic syndrome. Muscle biopsy was performed in 21 of 24 and was normal in 16. Diagnostic findings included nemaline rods, inclusion bodies, fiber size variability, and type-II fiber atrophy. Genetic testing with either a gene panel or exome sequencing was performed in 18 of 24 patients, with pathogenic variants detected in <i>ACTA1</i>, <i>NEB</i>, <i>SELENON</i>, <i>GRIN2B</i>, <i>SCN8A</i>, and <i>COMP</i> genes.窶コesults supporting a neuromuscular abnormality were found in 15 of 24. In six patients (25%), we confirmed a genetic diagnosis and 12 had a clinical neuromuscular diagnosis. The study suggests that combined use of neurophysiology and muscle biopsy in cases where genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis can be useful in children with delayed motor milestones and clinical evidence of a neuromuscular disease.
