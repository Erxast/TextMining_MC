Title : Arthrogryposis associated with unsuccessful attempts at termination of pregnancy.
Date : 1996
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report three cases of failed termination of pregnancy in which the children were subsequently born with arthrogryposis (AMC) (multiple congenital contractures). Arthrogryposis is a sign with many causes. We suggest that the multiple congenital contractures seen in these children are due to vascular compromise during the attempted termination with secondary loss of functional neurons leading to fetal akinesia and subsequent contractures. Two of the children have additional evidence of intrauterine vascular compromise. Limitation of movement secondary to the rupture of the fetal membranes and continuous leakage of amniotic fluid after the attempted termination may have compounded the contractures in two of the children.
