Title : [Congenital myopathy without specific features (minimal change myopathy)].
Date : 1989
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case of Congenital myopathy without specific features was reported. The main clinical findings were generalized muscle weakness and delayed developmental milestones. Histological and histochemical examination on the biopsied muscles demonstrated minimal nonspecific changes, mild variation in fiber size without structure and enzyme abnormality. No prominent necrotic changes were found and Ulrich and Fukuyama type of congenital myopathy were excluded. The abnormal muscle pathology was assumed to have resulted from delayed muscle fiber growth due to defective neural influence.
