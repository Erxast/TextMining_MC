Abstract : The conservative treatment of radial club hand should be initiated as early as possible, at best immediately after birth. The treatment consists of passive manipulation which is described in detail, and initial immobilization in corrected position. Later the treatment involves active and passive exercises combined with appropriate splints. This procedure has the following aim: progressive elimination of the contracture, improvement of mobility and range as well as promotion and training of important compensatory movements. This form of therapy can easily be carried out and does not require separation from the family or restriction of the child's liberty to move. Moreover, it is an essential prior condition for possible subsequent operative correction, for which the indications are discussed.
