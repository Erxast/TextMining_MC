Abstract : A case of congenital flexion deformity of the long, ring, and little fingers with an aberrant origin of the flexor digitorum profundus is described. The aberrant tendinous band originated from a bone prominence in the medial and anterior aspect of the proximal side of the ulna, which was confirmed in the operation. Resection of the aberrant origin could achieve only partial relief for the flexion contracture of the 3 fingers. Further muscle-sliding procedure was needed to achieve a thorough release.
