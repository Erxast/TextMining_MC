Abstract : Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) occurs silently usually during sleep and, though remaining unexplained after autopsy, leaves footprints creating a pattern analogous to that which follows a flood of nitric acid (NO). These footprints in SIDS are associated with serious pathological changes, viz. elevated hepatic iron, bone marrow hyperplasia, hypomyelinated respiratory control centres, elevated lung immunoglobulins, cerebral hypoperfusion resembling lesions induced by chronic hypoxemia, ischemia, congenital heart disease and congenital myopathy. Hypoxia stimulates the immune response and the over-arousal of the immune response triggers a flood of NO. Adenosine triggers sleep. NO and adenosine are additive as dilators of coronary blood vessels. Blood pressure collapses. Selenium increases the activity of the enzyme ferrochelatase during incorporation of heme into cytochrome oxidase. NO binds to cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting respiration. When NO reaches dangerous levels, the cell turns on production of heme oxygenase. Heme is broken down to iron (Fe) carbon monoxide (CO) and bile pigments. NO has a huge affinity for hemoglobin which catalyses NO degradation to nitrate. Furthermore, NO is a product of smoke and SIDS incidence is higher in smoking mothers.
