Abstract : Distal arthrogryposis type I is defined by congenital joint contractures of hands and feet and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The hands are most frequently involved than the feet, 98% and 88% of the cases, respectively. The authors report a family with five patients affected over four generations. This family demonstrates the marked intra-familial variability in expression of this condition. Inter-familial variability is also typical of distal arthrogryposis type I.
