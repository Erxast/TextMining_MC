Abstract : The gene mutated in the myodystrophy mouse, a model of muscular dystrophy, encodes a putative glycosyltransferase, Large. Mutations in genes encoding proteins thought to be involved in glycosylation have now been identified in six human forms of muscular dystrophy. Hereditary inclusion body myopathy and Nonaka myopathy result from defects in sialic acid production. Two forms of congenital muscular dystrophy, Fukuyama-type and MDC1C, result from mutations in members of the fukutin family. MDC1C and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I are allelic, as they are both associated with mutations in the FKRP gene. Mutations in POMGnT, which encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of O-mannosyl glycans, result in muscle-eye-brain disease--another congenital form of muscular dystrophy. Abnormal alpha-dystroglycan has been reported in the myodystrophy mouse, and in the congenital and limb girdle muscular dystrophies. Recent data have shown that there is altered glycosylation of the protein and that this reduces its ability to bind to extracellular matrix ligands such as laminin and agrin.
