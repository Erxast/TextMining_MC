Date : 2010
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital anomalies of the muscles of the lower extremity are rare. A case of complete absence of the semimembranosus muscle incidentally found with magnetic resonance imaging is reported. The patient was a 55-year-old female presenting with knee pain and no previous history of trauma. Clinical and imaging findings were consistent with meniscal tears. Two cases of uncommon distal insertion of the semimembranosus tendon are also described to illustrate the anatomical variations in this area. The anatomical and biomechanical relations between the semimembranosus muscle and the posteromedial corner of the knee are examined in this case report.
