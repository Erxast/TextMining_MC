Title : Pyloroduodenal duplication cyst.
Date : 1986
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Pyloroduodenal duplication cysts are an extremely rare congenital anomaly, whose clinical signs and symptoms often mimic those of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This radiographic analysis revealed configurational changes consistent with a large extrinsic mass rather than muscular hypertrophy, thus leading to the correct preoperative diagnosis.
