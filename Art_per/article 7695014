Abstract : Smooth-muscle hamartoma is an uncommon, usually congenital malformation of smooth-muscle origin. When it is acquired, it may be confused with Becker's nevus with a prominent smooth-muscle component. Over the past 3 decades, only two cases of acquired smooth-muscle hamartoma without the concomitant appearance of hairy-pigmented lesions have been reported. We describe a third case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of smooth-muscle hamartoma to occur in the scrotum.
