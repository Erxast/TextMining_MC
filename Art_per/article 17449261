Abstract : In contrast to the common clefts of the lip, alveolus and palate, the atypical clefts of the face may come in myriad patterns of clinical expression and are often not easy to define.In this report, a case of median craniofacial dysraphia is described.At presentation, the 3-month-old male patient had a bilateral complete cleft of the lip, alveolus and palate. The nose was wide and a horn was present on the nasal dorsum. 3-D CT AND MRI REVEALED: Duplication of the metopic suture ending at the wide anterior fontanel; orbital hypertelorism; midline cranial cleft ending just superior to the nasal dorsum; frontoethmoidal encephalocoele and holoprosencephaly. The presence of two metopic sutures was confirmed during surgery.The presented case carries the characteristics of the median cleft face syndrome. However, it differs from similar cases in two respects. First, the patient had two metopic sutures, one on either side of the cranial extension of the median cleft. Second, the patient had a bilateral cleft lip in contrast to the expected median cleft lip deformity.
