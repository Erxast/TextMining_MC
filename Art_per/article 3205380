Date : 1988
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A newborn with multiple congenital contractures (MCC) or arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and a leukodystrophy is described. The clinical features and neurophysiological studies suggested a disorder primarily involving the central white matter. The diagnosis of connatal Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease was made post mortem. This disorder of myelin formation should be considered in infants presenting with arthrogryposis.
