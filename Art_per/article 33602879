Abstract : To determine the carrier frequency and common mutations of Mendelian variants in Chinese couples using next-generation sequencing (NGS).Preconception expanded carrier testing using NGS was offered to women who attended the subfertility clinic. The test was then offered to the partners of women who had positive screening results. Carrier frequency was calculated, and the results of the NGS panel were compared with those of a target panel.One hundred twenty-three women and 20 of their partners were screened. Overall, 84 (58.7%) individuals were identified to be carriers of at least one disease, and 68 (47.6%) were carriers after excluding thalassaemias. The most common diseases found were GJB2-related DFNB1 nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness (1 in 4), alpha-thalassaemia (1 in 7), beta-thalassaemia (1 in 14), 21-hydroxylase deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia (1 in 13), Pendred's syndrome (1 in 36), Krabbe's disease (1 in 48), and spinal muscular atrophy (1 in 48). Of the 43 identified variants, 29 (67.4%) were not included in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics or American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines. Excluding three couples with alpha-thalassaemia, six at-risk couples were identified.The carrier frequency of the investigated members of the Chinese population was 58.7% overall and 47.6% after excluding thalassaemias. This frequency is higher than previously reported. Expanded carrier screening using NGS should be provided to Chinese people to improve the detection rate of carrier status and allow optimal pregnancy planning.
