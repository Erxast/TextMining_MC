Abstract : At Rancho Los Amigos Hospital on the Children's Orthopedic Service, 43 patients underwent anterior transfer of the posterior tibial tendon through the interosseous membrane between 1969 and 1979. This included 74 procedures for the following diagnoses: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, club-foot, cerebrospastic disease (cerebral palsy and head injury), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, scapuloperoneal dystrophy, and peroneal palsy. The purpose of this paper is to present the 54 of these transfers that have a minimum 2 year follow-up were performed with a uniform surgical technique, and had uniform postoperative management. This series is analyzed and compared with a review of the literature in order to set down guidelines for the use of the procedure. The analysis reveals that the patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who has decreasing gait function or brace fitting problems is the ideal candidate for the procedure with 26 of 28 satisfactory results. Gait electromyography was critical to the selection of the cerebrospastic patient for the transfer with those patients demonstrating swing-phase function of the posterior tibialis muscle yielding the best results. Finally, posterior tibial tendon transfer is generally not indicated in congenital clubfoot with six unsatisfactory results in 10 procedures, and the procedure should not be done in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease as part of staged treatment that includes a possible future hindfoot stabilization.
