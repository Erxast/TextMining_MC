Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The motor function of 25 children with spastic hemiplegia was examined retrospectively using videotapes recorded at 2-8 months of age. Many infants showed deficient forward movement of the arm and deficient opening of the hand on the affected side. At 7 and 8 months of age, whether the hand was semiflexed or clenched was correlated with the later upper extremity function. In the prone position, most could support their weight on the flexed arm on the affected side. In the supine position, half of the infants could not extend the knee on the affected side. At 2 months of age, asymmetry of the upper and lower extremity movements was not identified. Persistent primitive reflexes and abnormal truncal muscular tone were not recognized in the hemiplegic infants, and did not seem to be signs predicting hemiplegic cerebral palsy.
