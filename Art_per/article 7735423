Abstract : Myositis ossificans progressiva is a rare progressive disease of connective tissue with a poor prognosis.A 16 year-old girl suffered from lameness of her right leg associated with inguinal swelling. Progressive aggravation of pain with extension of swelling to the posterior part of her thigh required an X-ray examination which showed hip dysplasia and calcifications around the hip. Angiography was normal; a diagnosis of hematoma was suggested by scannography and bone scintigraphy, but biopsy showed features of nodular fasciitis. The association of progressive ectopic ossification to malformation of the big toe led to diagnosis of myositis ossificans progressiva.Congenital malformations, most commonly of big toes and thumbs, are important for distinguishing myositis ossificans progressiva from other diseases of muscle.
