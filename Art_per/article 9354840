Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two brothers with congenital microcephaly, growth and mental retardation, flexion contractures, dorsal edema of hands and feet, and ichthyotic skin changes are described. Mild manifestations of Neu-Laxova syndrome have to be considered but long survival and only mild intrauterine growth retardation not described in this syndrome may be evidence of a different condition.
