Title : Arthrogryposis-palatoschisis and a 1/29 translocation in a Charolais herd.
Date : 1977
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The congenital condition of arthrogryposis palatoschisis was found in two closely related Charolais calves and has subsequently been found in a number of other related animals. It would appear from this and earlier reports that the condition is inherited, possibly as an autosomal recessive. A 1/29 Robertsonian translocation was also found in one of the calves and this was inherited from its dam. It is considered that the two conditions are not directly related.
