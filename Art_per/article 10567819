Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 25-year-old woman with negative family history and delayed motor development presented hypotrophy of the right lower limb and calf hypertrophy since age 7 and she complained of muscle weakness since 23. Neurological examination showed a thin elongated face, high-arched palate, high-pitched voice, proximal wasting and weakness, impairment of distal muscles in the lower limbs. CK was 3, 034 U/l, EMG showed a myopathic pattern. Muscle biopsy displayed dystrophic features with diffuse dystrophin deficiency; immunoblotting demonstrated quantitative reduction of the protein and normal molecular weight. Lyonization study showed skewed X-inactivation with the maternal X active. Seven years' follow-up did not show progression of the disease.
