Abstract : The aim of this study was to report the results of early open reduction of hip dislocations in infants with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Seven patients who were under 6 months of age at the time of hip reduction, with a mean follow-up period of 47.5Â±11.3 months after surgery, were included in this study. Four of seven patients (six of 13 hips) required additional hip surgeries during their follow-up. The short-term results of early open reduction of hips were not promising as most of the patients required additional hip surgeries.
