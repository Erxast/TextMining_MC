Title : Prevalence of unsuspected myopathy in infants presenting for clubfoot surgery.
Date : 1995
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The objective of this study was an evaluation of the prevalence of myopathies in paediatric patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery (clubfoot) performed under regional anaesthesia. Seventeen infants scheduled for lower limb orthopaedic surgery were studied to verify coexisting neuromuscular disorders with electromyography and muscle biopsy during surgery. All surgical procedures were performed under caudal block or spinal anaesthesia, associated with light general anaesthesia. No major cardiorespiratory, neurological or malignant hyperthermic complications (muscle rigidity, arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia) were observed. Combined neurological, electromyographic and biopsy studies showed a high rate of myopathic changes (70%). Performance of clubfoot surgery under light general anaesthesia with regional techniques was free from any problems. The high rate of myopathic changes (70%) observed in the muscle biopsies suggests that precautions should be taken with paediatric patients for clubfoot surgery and a regional anaesthesia technique with adequate monitoring may be helpful to prevent possible malignant hyperthermia related problems.
