Abstract : Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a congenital myopathy of great heterogeneity, characterized by the presence of rods in the cytoplasm of muscle fibers. The samples of 16 nemaline myopathy patients diagnosed by characteristically pathological features went through whole exon sequencing. Clinico-pathological and genetic features of the cases were systematically analyzed. According to the classification of nemaline myopathy by ENMC, 8 cases are typical congenital subtype, 6 cases are childhood/juvenile onset subtype and 2 case are adult onset subtype. In histological findings, characteristic purple-colored rods are discovered under modified gömöri trichrome staining (MGT). Electron microscopy revealed the presence of high electron-dense nemaline bodies around the submucosa and the nucleus nine patients (9/16 56.3%) were detected pathogenic causative mutations, among whom mutations in the NEB gene were the most frequent (6 patients, 66.7%). KBTBD13 gene mutation was discovered in two patients and ACTA1 gene mutation was discovered in 1 patient. Nemaline myopathy is a congenital myopathy with highly clinico-pathological and genetic heterogeneity. NEB gene mutation is the most common mutation, in which splicing change c.21522 +3A > G is hotspot mutation in Chinese NM patients.
