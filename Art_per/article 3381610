Title : [Clinical characteristics and differential diagnosis of congenital myopathies].
Date : 1988
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Sixteen patients with congenital myopathies with the onset of the disease in early childhood were examined. All patients were subjected to morphological investigation of biopsy samples of muscle tissue, using histochemical methods for the determination of the activity of redox and glycolysis enzymes. A clinical polymorphism of these forms of myodystrophies and the presence of nondifferentiated variants were established. The distribution of the activities of oxidation and glycolysis enzymes was histochemically different.
