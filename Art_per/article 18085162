Abstract : A male, 10 month old llama with malformation of both front limbs was presented. Both front limbs had one more digit located medially. The distal phalanx of this additional digit at the left front limb reached the ground by the tip of the keratinzed pad and the toenail. The accessory digit at the right front limb was bent in a 90 degree angle caudolateraly. Beside the digital bones of the accessory digits the second metacarpal bone and the first carpal bone could be detected in both front limbs by radiological examination. Secondary a bilateral slight carpal valgus deformity could be seen.
