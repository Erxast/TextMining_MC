Abstract : A 2-day-old Quarter Horse colt was presented to the Atlantic Veterinary College for recumbency and diarrhea. Dietary history of the dam, serum biochemistry findings, and whole blood selenium levels were consistent with nutritional myodegeneration. The patient was treated successfully with fluid therapy and broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged with a favorable prognosis.
