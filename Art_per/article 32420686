Abstract : Î±B-crystallin is a promiscuous protein involved in numerous cell functions. Mutations in CRYAB have been found in patients with different pathological phenotypes that are not properly understood. Patients can present different diseases like cataracts, muscle weakness, myopathy, cardiomyopathy, respiratory insufficiency or dysphagia, but also a variable combination of these pathologies has been found. These mutations can show either autosomal dominant or recessive mode of inheritance and variable penetrance and expressivity. This is the first report of congenital cataracts and myopathy described in childhood due to a CRYAB mutation with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.The whole exome sequence was subjected to phenotype-driven analysis and a novel variant in CRYAB was detected: c.514delG, p.(Ala172ProfsTer14). The mutation was located in the C-terminal domain of the protein, which is essential for chaperone activity. The deduced protein was analyzed searching for alterations of the relevant physico-chemical properties described for this domain. A muscle biopsy was also tested for CRYAB with immunohistochemical and histoenzymatic techniques.CRYAB displayed a mild immunoreactivity in the subsarcolemmal compartment with no pathological sarcoplasmic accumulation. It agrees with an alteration of the physico-chemical properties predicted for the C-terminal domain: hydrophobicity, stiffness, and isomerization.The described mutation leads to elongation of the protein at the carboxi-terminal domain (CTD) with altered properties, which are essential for solubility and activity. It suggests that can be the cause of the severe conditions observed in this patient.
