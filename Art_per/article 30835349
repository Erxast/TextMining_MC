Abstract : To carry out mutation analysis for a Chinese family affected with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS).Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to screen potential mutations within genomic DNA extracted from the proband. Suspected mutation was validated by combining clinical data and results of Sanger sequencing.A homozygous deletional mutation c.3665_3675delGTGCTGTCTTA (p.S1222fs) was found in the proband, for which her parents were both heterozygous carriers.WES is capable of detecting mutation underlying this disorder and facilitating genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for the affected family. A novel pathogenic mutation of the SACS gene was discovered.
