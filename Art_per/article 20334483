Abstract : Imperforate hymen is a rare congenital malformation to present with symptoms in the neonatal period. We present a case of a 5-day-old neonate with a marked interlabial swelling causing urinary retention. Imaging revealed hydrometrocolpos, hydrosalpinx, and bilateral hydronephrosis. Additionally, our patient had polydactyly of both feet and hands, and laryngocele that have not been previously described in literature. Hymenectomy is the mainstay of management to prevent the development of hematocolpos, pain, and possible retrograde menstruation.
