Abstract : Mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) associated with congenital myopathy with excess of thin myofilaments, nemaline myopathy and intranuclear rod myopathy were first described in 1999. At that time, only 15 different missense mutations were known in ACTA1. More than 60 mutations have now been identified. This review analyses this larger spectrum of mutations in ACTA1. It investigates the molecular consequences of the mutations found to date, provides a framework for genotype-phenotype correlation and suggests future studies in light of results of investigation of normal and mutant actin in other systems, notably the actin specific to the indirect flight muscles of Drosophila. The larger series confirms that the majority of ACTA1 mutations are dominant, a small number are recessive and most isolated cases with no previous family history have de novo dominant mutations. The severity of the disease caused ranges from lack of spontaneous movements at birth requiring immediate mechanical ventilation, to mild disease compatible with life to adulthood. Overall, the mutations within ACTA1 are randomly distributed throughout the protein. However, the larger series of mutations now available indicates that there may be clustering of mutations associated with some phenotypes, e.g. actin myopathy. This would suggest that interference with certain actin functions may be more associated with certain phenotypes, though the exact pathophysiology of the actin mutations remains unknown.
