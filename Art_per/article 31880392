Abstract : Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. Pathogenic variants in DOK7 are known to cause myasthenic syndrome, congenital, 10 (MIM#254300) and, rarely (reported in a single family) lethal FADS. Herein, we describe a biallelic variant c.1263dupC in DOK7, known to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome 10, causing lethal FADS in a consanguineous family. The present report illustrates wide phenotypic variability caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in DOK7. We also describe the second family with FADS due to pathogenic variants in DOK7.
