Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis cubiti and neurodevelopment delay. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the KMT2A gene. This report describes two unrelated Portuguese patients, age 11 and 17â€‰years, with a phenotype concordant with WSS and clinical and molecular diagnosis of WSS by the identification of two novel frameshift variants in the KMT2A gene. This work also highlights the presence of certain clinical features in patients with growth retardation and development delay and should draw attention to the diagnosis of WSS, when hirsutism, particularly hypertrichosis cubiti is present.
