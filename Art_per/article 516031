Title : [Fractures of the vertebrae in newborn calves (author's transl)].
Date : 1979
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A letter to the Editor on fractures of the vertebrae in newborn calves is commented upon (Tijdschr. Diergeneesk., 104, 557, (1979)). Supplementary data is supplied and a theory regarding the pathogenesis is suggested. Intense muscular contractions during an attack of asphyxia could be the cause of these fractures of the vertebrae. Although non-genetic factors are bound to play an important role in the pathogenesis of asphyxia, genetic factors (probably showing a hereditary pattern which is more complex than singly recessive) also may help to produce these fractures.
