Abstract : Recent advances in pediatric surgery have been made in several fields. Hydrocephalus is again being treated by draining the cerebrospinal fluid into either the ureter, the mastoid antrum or the peritoneal cavity. Funnel chest should be corrected surgically. Congenital atresia of the esophagus is best treated by a one-stage operative repair. Patent ductus should be closed. Operations are available for cyanotic children. Intussusception is again being treated by barium enema in selected cases. Megacolon can be benefited by surgical procedures, which now are directed at the distal spastic segment rather than the proximal dilated segment.
