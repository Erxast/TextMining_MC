Abstract : To detect pathological variant in a Chinese pedigree affected with congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA).Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to scan the whole exome of the proband. Potential variant of the FBN2 gene was also detected in all members of the pedigree and 100 healthy controls by Sanger sequencing. With the determination of the genotype, prenatal diagnosis was carried out by amniotic fluid sampling.A c.3528C>A (p.Asn1176Lys) variant was identified in the FBN2 gene of the proband, other patients from this pedigree, as well as the fetus. The same variant was not found among healthy members from this pedigree and the 100 healthy controls.The c.3528C>A (p.Asn1176Lys) variant of the FBN2 gene probably underlies the pathogenesis of CCA in our case. The new variant has enriched pathological spectrum of the FBN2 gene.
