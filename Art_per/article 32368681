Abstract : Rhabdomyolysis (RM), a fortunately rare disease of the striated muscle cells, is a complication of non-traumatic (congenital (glycogen storage disease, discrete mitochondrial myopathies and various muscular dystrophies) or acquired (alcoholic myopathy, systemic diseases, arterial occlusion, viral illness or bacterial sepsis)) and traumatic conditions. Additionally, RM can occur in some individuals under specific circumstances such as toxic substance use and illicit drug abuse. Lipid-lowering drugs in particular are capable of causing RM. This comprehensive review will focus on non-traumatic and non-drug-induced RM. Moreover, the pathology of RM, its clinical manifestation and biochemical effects, and finally its management will be discussed.
