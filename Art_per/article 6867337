Title : Brief clinical communication: neurogenic perineal prolapse in neonates.
Date : 1983
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Disturbed innervation of the pelvic muscular diaphragm from lumbosacral myelodysplasia and other osseous dysplasias results in flaccid paralysis of the perineum. This permits excessive downward herniation, most noticeable in neonates, of the lower abdominal and pelvic organs. The radiographic changes occurring with organ descensus may be transitory and diverse, and recognition of these various findings is important to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary further investigations. Several examples of the radiographic changes are presented.
