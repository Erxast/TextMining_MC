Title : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. A long-term follow-up study.
Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Most patients with arthrogryposis function well in adult life; however, many remain partially dependent upon others (parents, relatives, government subsidy). This dependency was more closely related to personality, education, and overall coping skills than to degree of physical deformity. Properly sequenced corrective surgical procedures are required to maximize musculoskeletal function. In addition to appropriate surgical correction, good family support, a proper educational environment, and promotion of independence at an early age are required to achieve maximal adult function.
