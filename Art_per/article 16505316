Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors reviewed the obstetric histories of 42 women of 37 families with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2). Nine women (21%) had the first symptoms during pregnancy and worsening in subsequent pregnancies. Of 96 pregnancies, 13% ended as early and 4% as late miscarriages. Preterm labor occurred in 50% of pregnancies resulting in 27% preterm deliveries in women with overt DM2 in pregnancy. There was no evidence of a congenital DM2.
