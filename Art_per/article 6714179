Date : 1984
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Duplications are congenital lesions, spherical or tubular in shape and composed of a muscular wall with a gastrointestinal lining. They may be found at any level from the mouth to the anus, and are usually intimately attached to some portion of the gastrointestinal tract (1, 2). The endoscopic removal of both primary duodenal polyps and prolapsing antral polyps which cause outlet obstruction has been previously described. We report a case of a symptomatic duplication cyst of the apex of the duodenal bulb, which was removed endoscopically. A patient with outlet obstruction symptoms due to a duplication cyst of the duodenal apex is described. Complete cessation of symptoms followed endoscopic removal of the cyst.
