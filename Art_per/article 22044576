Abstract : Here we describe a patient with a new malformation syndrome which shows similarities with Yunis-Varon syndrome (YVS). Prenatal presentation included polyhydramnios, increased nuchal translucency, and bilateral hydrothoraces requiring pigtail insertion. Postnatal presentation revealed primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), persistent hydrothoraces, one atrial and two ventricular septal defects, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis, dilated interhemispheric ventricles, severe developmental delay with general muscular hypotonia, retinal anomalies, sparse scalp hair, sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, hypo- and aplastic nails, low-set dysplastic ears, loose nuchal skin, hypo- and aplastic distal phalanges of the toes as well as postnatal failure to thrive. High resolution molecular karyotyping in the patient did not reveal any causative chromosomal aberration. Since one patient with YVS and PPH has been previously reported, we assume a similar pathogenic pathway. However, molecular confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is not yet possible. It remains uncertain if the presented syndrome can be classified as YVS with PPH or if it constitutes a new YVS like entity.
