Date : 2005
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a rare congenital disorder of mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA). Patients with this syndrome may present to the otolaryngologist with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that is genetic in origin. Mitochondrial cytopathies can present with a variety of symptoms, but they occasionally present with SNHL as their first manifestation. Two cases of MELAS patients who responded well to cochlear implantation are presented. A review of the literature is also carried out focusing mainly on diagnosis, anesthetic considerations and management of these patients.
