Abstract : We studied the effect of 1:1,000,000 epinephrine concentration (1 per mil) to attain a bloodless operative field in hand and upper extremity surgery and to explore its effectiveness and safety profile.This retrospective observational study enrolled 45 consecutive patients with 63 operative fields consisting of various hand and upper extremity problems. One-per-mil solution was injected into the operative field with tumescent technique to create a bloodless operating field without tourniquet. The solution was formulated by adding a 1:1,000,000 concentration of epinephrine and 100 mg of lidocaine into saline solution to form 50 mL of tumescent solution. Observation was performed on the clarity of the operative field, which we described as totally bloodless, minimal bleeding, acceptable bleeding, or bloody. The volume of tumescent solution injected, duration of surgery, and surgical outcome were also reviewed.The tumescent technique with 1-per-mil solution achieved 29% totally bloodless, 48% minimal bleeding, 22% acceptable bleeding, and 2% bloody operative fields in cases that included burn contracture and congenital hand and upper extremity surgeries.One-per-mil tumescent solution created a clear operative field in hand and upper extremity surgery. It proved safe and effective for a wide range of indications.Therapeutic IV.
