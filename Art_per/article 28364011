Abstract : Arthrogryposis is among the malformations of congenital Zika syndrome. Similar to the brain, there might exist a spectrum of spinal cord abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe in detail the MR imaging features found in the spinal cords, nerve roots, and brains of children with congenital Zika syndrome with and without arthrogryposis.Twelve infants with congenital Zika syndrome (4 with arthrogryposis and 8 without) who had undergone brain and spinal cord MR imaging were retrospectively selected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed and compared between groups.At visual inspection, both groups showed reduced thoracic spinal cord thickness: 75% (6/8) of the group without arthrogryposis and 100% (4/4) of the arthrogryposis group. However, the latter had the entire spinal cord reduced and more severely reduced conus medullaris anterior roots (respectively, <i>P</i> = .002 and .007). Quantitative differences were found for conus medullaris base and cervical and lumbar intumescences diameters (respectively, <i>P</i> = .008, .048, .008), with more prominent reduction in arthrogryposis. Periventricular calcifications were more frequent in infants with arthrogryposis (<i>P</i> = .018).Most infants had some degree of spinal cord thickness reduction, predominant in the thoracic segment (without arthrogryposis) or in the entire spinal cord (with arthrogryposis). The conus medullaris anterior roots were reduced in both groups (thinner in arthrogryposis). A prominent anterior median fissure of the spinal cord was absent in infants without arthrogryposis. Brain stem hypoplasia was present in all infants with arthrogryposis, periventricular calcifications, in the majority, and polymicrogyria was absent.
