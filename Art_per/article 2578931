Abstract : Several modifications of turns and mean amplitude analysis of the electrical activity of muscles have been suggested to avoid measurement of force. Previously we have shown that these modifications may overlook abnormalities if the analysis is performed at high force. A new modification is suggested: analysing the maximal value of the ratio of turns to mean amplitude (peak ratio), using the mean amplitude as an indication of force. It has been applied to a material in which the force was measured. The peak ratio was increased in 82% of 17 patients with myopathy and decreased in 36% of 14 patients with neurogenic disorders.
