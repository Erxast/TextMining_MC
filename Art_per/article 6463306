Date : 1984
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The study of two families with myotonic dystrophy enables us to recall the existence of two congenital forms: one severe form with important neonatal hypotonia and one mild form with talipes equinovarus and intellectual deficiency. In both forms EMG detection is very often of the myogenic type. It confirms the diagnosis of myopathic disorder.
