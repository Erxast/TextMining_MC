Abstract : Cleft palate and minor front limb contractures were induced in calves by maternal ingestion of the piperidine alkaloid-containing lupines, Lupinus formosus and L. arbustus. Crooked calf disease, which includes an occasional cleft palate, is a congenital condition of widespread occurrence in cattle in the western U.S. and Canada. It is known to occur after maternal ingestion of certain species of Lupinus during specific gestational periods. Although many lupine species contain quinolizidine alkaloids including the teratogenic alkaloid anagyrine, L. formosus and L. arbustus produce piperidine alkaloids including the reported teratogen ammodendrine. In addition to ammodendrine, L. formosus contains both N-acetyl hystrine and N-methyl ammodendrine, whereas L. arbustus contains ammodendrine, trace amounts of N-methyl ammodendrine, and no N-acetyl hystrine. L. formosus and L. arbustus were fed to pregnant cows at equivalent ammodendrine doses during a 10-day period from days 40-50 of gestation. One calf from a cow fed L. formosus had a full cleft palate. Embryonic death and resorption of one fetus and minor front limb contractures (arthrogryposis) in another calf occurred with two cows fed L. arbustus. Alkaloid analysis of blood samples taken during the feeding period, and up to and including 48 hours after the last dose, demonstrated comparative plasma elimination times with N-methyl ammodendrine > ammodendrine > N-acetyl hystrine. The objectives of this experiment were to: 1) determine if N-acetyl hystrine is a potential teratogen; and 2) define the narrow cleft palate induction period in cows.
