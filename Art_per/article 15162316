Title : Kirner's deformity treated by distal detachment of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon.
Date : 2004 Apr-Jun
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Kirner's deformity may be due to a very distal insertion of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon along the palmar surface of the distal phalanx of the small finger. Distal detachment of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon has already led to encouraging results. Intraoperative findings, surgical technique and results are shown.
