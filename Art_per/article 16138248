Abstract : We report a novel type of congenital myopathy, which is characterized by an early arrest of muscle formation prior to formation of myotubes. A female infant born prematurely at 32 weeks of gestational age died after six weeks of continuous ventilatory support. Various muscle specimens including quadriceps, deltoid, pectoral, neck, psoas, tongue, and diaphragm musculature were studied. Light and electron microscopy revealed well-demarcated fascicular structures interspersed with undifferentiated, mononuclear myogenic cells. Multinucleated myotubes and muscle fibres were not detectable, pointing towards a defect prior to the generation of myotubes during myogenesis. Immunohistochemistry identified the absence of dystrophin, N-CAM, MyoD and myogenin expression in these myogenic cells, compatible with a block of the complex transcriptional network necessary for correct embryonic muscle formation at an early stage of muscle development. These myopathological findings were absent in cardiac muscle, indicating that the defect exclusively affects skeletal muscle formation.
