Abstract : Management of anaesthesia and intubation using a flexible endoscope of the ultra-thin generation (external diameter on the distal end 2.7 mm) of brother and sister with congenital ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint is described. Sedation was provided with ketamine while maintaining spontaneous breathing. Alternative methods to overcome difficult intubation in infants and small children with consideration of their specific anatomical conditions are discussed. Insertion of a fiberoptic endoscope through the endotracheal tube in the age group reported here was not possible hitherto. The new ultra-thin generation of flexible fiberscopes now makes it possible to perform direct fiberoptic intubation of infants and small children.
