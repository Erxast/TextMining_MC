Abstract : In a screen for organogenesis defects in N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutant mice, we discovered a line carrying a mutation in <i>Colgalt1</i> [collagen beta(1-O)galactosyltransferase type 1], which is required for proper galactosylation of hydroxylysine residues in a number of collagens. <i>Colgalt1</i> mutant embryos have not been previously characterized; here, we show that they exhibit skeletal and muscular defects. Analysis of mutant-derived embryonic fibroblasts reveals that COLGALT1 acts on collagen IV and VI, and, while collagen VI appears stable and its secretion is not affected, collagen IV accumulates inside of cells and within the extracellular matrix, possibly due to instability and increased degradation. We also generated mutant zebrafish that do not express the duplicated orthologs of mammalian <i>Colgalt1</i> The double-homozygote mutants have muscle defects; they are viable through the larvae stage but do not survive to 10â€…days post-fertilization. We hypothesize that the <i>Colgalt1</i> mutant could serve as a model of a human connective tissue disorder and/or congenital muscular dystrophy or myopathy.
