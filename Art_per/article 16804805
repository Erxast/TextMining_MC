Title : [Isolated pareses of the terminal branches of the facial nerve: clinical findings, etiology and differential diagnosis].
Date : 2006
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Clinical findings from 35 patients with isolated paralyses of distinct branches of the facial nerve are demonstrated. Presumably because of its position, the mandibular marginal ramus has most often been affected (n = 21) followed by buccal (n = 6) and temporal branches (n = 4). In two patients, the pattern of perioral muscular pareses was compatible with lesions of more than one branch. Causes for the facial nerve branch lesions were iatrogenic (n = 25), tumor (n = 4), trauma (n = 2), inflammatory (n = 1), idiopathic (n = 1) and congenital (n = 2). The impact of the clinical investigation to distinguish supranuclear lesions is emphasized.
