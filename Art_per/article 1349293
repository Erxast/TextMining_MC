Abstract : Dropfoot is a catchall term for ankle equinus, equinovarus, and equinovalgus. The deformity can be flexible or rigid and may be associated with other pathology. In the adult, dropfoot may be congenital or acquired. Acquired dropfoot results from weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors, overpull of the plantarflexors, contracture of the soft tissues, bony deformity, or any combination of these factors. Appropriate treatment includes observation, orthotic devices, bracing, tendon transfers, arthrodesis, and neurolysis. The purpose of this paper is to review the pathophysiology and treatment of acquired dropfoot.
