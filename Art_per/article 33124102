Abstract : Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) and congenital myopathies (CMs) are a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous degenerative primary muscle disorders with onset at birth or during infancy. Due to vast heterogeneity, clinical examination and protein-based analyses often fail to identify the genetic causes of these diseases. The aim of this study was to genetically diagnose a cohort of 36 difficult-to-diagnose CMD and CM cases of Indian origin using next-generation sequencing methods.Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify pathogenic mutations in previously reported CMD and CM-related genes using variant calling and stringent variant filtration process. Subsequently, in silico homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) studies were undertaken for a number of novel and missense variants.A total of 33 and 21 rare and deleterious mutations were identified in 28 genes previously reported in CMD and CM based on OMIM, ClinVar and Orphanet, respectively. We could accurately diagnose 54% patients (n = 12/22) in the CMD group and 35% patients (n = 5/14) in the CM group. Furthermore, MDS studies for mutations located in LMNA, LAMA2 and RYR1 suggest that the wild-type proteins are more stable than their mutant counterparts, implying a potential mechanism of pathogenesis.The WES findings led us to identify reported as well as novel variants for the first time in Indian patients with CMD and CM. This allowed us to achieve an accurate genetic diagnosis, which was difficult using conventional diagnostic tools. Transferring these WES findings to clinical practice will help guide clinical care of the affected patients and inform genetic counselling.
