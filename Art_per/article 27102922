Abstract : To identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of temporomandibular joints (TMJs) in healthy children.This was a retrospective study of children younger than 18 years undergoing MRI of the head for non-autoimmune indications at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Atlanta, GA). Patients with congenital or acquired conditions associated with potential TMJ pathology were excluded. Medical records and MRIs were reviewed to document demographic data. Three neuroradiologists independently recorded specific predetermined MRI findings of the TMJ. The outcome variable was the presence or absence of TMJ findings at MRI. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to identify associations (significant at P ≤ .05).Eighty-seven patients (54 boys, 33 girls; mean age, 11.2 yr) met the inclusion criteria. Seventy percent of TMJs had condylar enhancement, 64% of joints had glenoid marginal synovial enhancement, 56% had condylar margin synovial enhancement, and 19% had condylar T1 hyperintense signal. There were no joints with condylar erosion, condylar volume loss, or effusion. Findings of normal marrow development were decreased condylar enhancement and greater condylar T1 signal with increased age.This study found a greater than 60% prevalence of synovial enhancement in healthy children. In a healthy child, MRI findings of TMJ synovial enhancement should be carefully correlated with a clinical evaluation.
