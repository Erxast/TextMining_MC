Abstract : Lamin A and C are nuclear filament proteins encoded by the LMNA gene. Mutations in the LMNA gene cause many congenital diseases known as laminopathies, including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with conduction disease. A missense mutation (N195K) in the A-type lamins results in familial DCM and sudden arrhythmic death.The purpose of this study was to investigate the ion current mechanism of arrhythmia and DCM caused by the LaminA-N195K variant.A homozygous mouse line expressing the Lmna-N195K mutation (Lmna<sup>N195K/N195K</sup>) that exhibited arrhythmia, DCM, and sudden death was used. Using whole cell patch-clamp technique, we measured action potential duration (APD), Na<sup>+</sup> currents (I<sub>Na</sub>) in ventricular myocytes isolated from Lmna<sup>N195K/N195K</sup>, and wild-type mice.Both peak and late I<sub>Na</sub> were significantly (P <.05) increased in Lmna<sup>N195K/N195K</sup> ventricular myocytes. Similarly, Lmna<sup>N195K/N195K</sup> ventricular myocytes exhibited significant (P <.005) prolongation of APD (time to 50% [APD<sub>50</sub>] and 90% [APD<sub>90</sub>] repolarization) and triggered activity. Acute application of ranolazine inhibited late I<sub>Na</sub>, shortened APD, and abolished triggered activity in Lmna<sup>N195K/N195K</sup> ventricular myocytes.Inhibition of late I<sub>Na</sub> may be an effective therapy in preventing arrhythmia in patients with LmnaN195K mutation-related DCM.
