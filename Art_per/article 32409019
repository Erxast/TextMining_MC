Abstract : The non-encapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae (NESp) has emerged and increased in the clinical setting. The majority of NESp strains have been isolated from the nasopharynxes of healthy carriers and from respiratory specimens of patients with otitis media. NESp strains were shown to be more effective than encapsulated counterparts at forming biofilms. Therefore, NESp should become one of the leading causes of emerging refractory respiratory disease after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We report the first case of multidrug-resistant - including fluoroquinolone-resistant - NESp isolated from the intrabronchial aspirate of a patient with pneumonia. Drug-resistant NESp infections can possibly emerge as a clinical problem and thus the continuous monitoring of NESp infections is of utmost importance.
