Title : The management of metatarsus adductus et supinatus.
Date : 1984
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Forty-three patients with 69 feet affected by isolated metatarsus adductus et supinatus were reviewed. Of these, 20 patients (with 31 involved feet) had been treated expectantly and spontaneous resolution had occurred with time. The remaining 23 patients (with 38 feet) had required anteromedial release; the operative technique is described. Excellent results were uniformly achieved in both groups, with neither recurrence nor complications in the operatively treated feet. There was a consistent correlation between good clinical results and a naviculo -metatarsal angle of less than 100 degrees. The timing of soft-tissue release did not influence the final outcome.
