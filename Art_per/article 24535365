Abstract : To summarize the etiology and clinical characteristics of children with myopathic elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. The degrees of elevated CK as well as lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in different myopathy were analyzed.The clinical data of 235 cases characterized as myopathic hyper-CK-emia from January 2004 to December 2011 were collected and analyzed. A retrospective analysis of LDH and AST levels according to CK in part of the patients were reviewed.Of the 235 cases, 180 were male and 55 female. According to the age at which hyper-CK-emia was diagnosed, 64 cases were under 6 months, 90 between 6 months and 3 years, 50 between 3 and 6 years and 31 between 6 and 14 years. Their CK levels significantly increased in 162 cases, moderately increased in 31 cases, and slightly increased in 42 cases. The age at which hyper-CK-emia was diagnosed and the CK level had no correlation with muscle weakness and the severity. As to CK levels: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) > inflammatory myopathies > congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) > metabolic myopathies. LDH and AST levels: DMD > inflammatory myopathies > metabolic myopathies > CMD.Unlike adults, the etiology of myopathic hyper-CK-emia in children is complicated and diverse. The onset type, the degree and duration of hyper-CK-emia are helpful to make the diagnosis. CK increases most significantly in DMD, then in inflammatory myopathies, CMD, and metabolic myopathies. Diagnostic flowchart of myogenic hyper-CK-emia should follow a certain process, and the indications of biochemical tests, metabolic screening, electrophysiological examination, muscle biopsy and genetic testing should be made. Finally, different treatments should be designed according to the etiology.
