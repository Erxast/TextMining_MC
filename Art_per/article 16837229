Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital contracture of the quadriceps muscle can be defined as progressive loss of knee flexion due to fibrosis within the muscle without a history of trauma or intramuscular injection into the thighs. In the course of time, secondary changes might develop and vitiate the end result so this rare childhood disease needs particular attention for early diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we report a 14-year-old girl presented with inability to bend her knees completely. The clinical and radiological assessment was detailed with magnetic resonance imaging findings.
