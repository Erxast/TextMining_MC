Abstract : There is no comprehensive overview concerning the phenotypic variability in patients carrying <i>SLC25A4</i> mutations available. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to summarise and discuss recent findings concerning the clinical presentation and phenotypic heterogeneity of <i>SLC25A4</i> mutations. The study was conducted by systematically reviewing the literature using the search terms 'mitochondrial', "myopathy', 'nuclear DNA', 'mitochondrial DNA', in combination with 'SLC25A4' or 'AAC1'. The results indicated that the phenotypic heterogeneity in patients carrying a <i>SLC25A4</i> mutation is broader than so far anticipated. Patients carrying a <i>SLC25A4</i> mutation not only manifest as encephalo-myo-cardiomyopathy but also with scoliosis, cataract, depression, headache, hydrocephalus or arterial hypertension. <i>SLC25A4</i> mutations may result in mtDNA depletion or multiple mitochondrial (mt)DNA deletions. <i>SLC25A4</i>-associated mtDNA depletion presents with the more severe phenotype and the worse outcome than patients with multiple mtDNA deletions. Depletion syndrome due to <i>SLC25A4</i> mutations is associated with congenital respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation with poor prognosis in the majority of the cases. Mutations in the <i>SLC25A4</i> gene manifest phenotypically with multiorgan abnormalities in addition to encephalo-myo-cardiomyopathy. <i>SLC25A4</i> mutations, causing mtDNA depletion, present with a more severe phenotype, including respiratory insufficiency and more widespread cerebral disease than mutations causing multiple mtDNA deletions.
