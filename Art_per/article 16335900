Abstract : Giant diverticula of the small intestine and colon are rare. Four cases treated at our institution in the last year are reported and compared to published cases; specific features and those which differentiate them from abdominal pseudocysts are described. They most commonly present a clinical tableau similar to commonplace diverticular disease. Awareness of this unusual condition and a good CT study are the keys to diagnosis. Giant diverticula may be acquired or congenital. The acquired type is simply a more spectacular version of commonplace diverticulosis while the congenital type, having a muscular wall and myenteric plexus, is more akin to intestinal duplications. Treatment is surgical and, in the case of sigmoid giant diverticula, usually requires a colon resection similar to that required for sigmoid diverticulitis.
