Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy is a highly variable autosomic dominant inherited multisystemic disease. We review our 18 years experience with patients suffering from this disease.Eleven patients were identified following a molecular genetic study: 2 patients died, 5 are still under control, 2 are being controlled in another Centre, and 3 dropped out. Three of them were relatives. Seven newborns started with hypotonic symptoms in the neonatal period, with hypotonic symptoms, of which 4 had foetal suffering. One child was diagnosed at age of 3 due to her father being affected. One girl was seen at age of 10 due to stiffness and tightening of her hands for years. One boy, aged 5, was examined due to abnormal hands posture, and a 4 year old child due to psychomotor delay. Associated disorders: 7 children with psychomotor delay, 2 cases of cataracts, 1 case of diabetes type I, 3 cases of hypercholesterolemia, 1 abdominal sarcoma, 1 case of femur and hip fracture, 2 cases of interatrial communication. The diagnostic was made in 5 cases by a clinic due to mother-son relation phenotype, in 3 cases after the family diagnosis and in another 3 cases non-congenital symptoms exclusively in the child's clinic.In our experience, myotonic dystrophy is uncommon; it is often congenital, and is associated with perinatal suffering. Genetics can identify or exclude the process. This must be done on newborns who are hypotonic for an unknown reason. It should be suspected in a child who presents with motor abnormalities in the fingers and hands.
