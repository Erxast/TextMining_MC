Title : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita occurring with maternal multiple sclerosis.
Date : 1984
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : All children of a mother with multiple sclerosis (MS) had increasing grades of congenital joint contractures without demonstrable neuromuscular disease. Two had talipes equinovarus, one had congenital hip subluxation, and the youngest had arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Maternal MS may be causally related to the development of congenital joint contractures.
