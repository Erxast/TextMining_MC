Title : Joint motion limitation in newborns.
Date : 1980
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Fifty neonates were evaluated and followed for 2 years with attention to the passive range of joint motion. Passive range of motion was symmetrical throughout this period. Only the hips were noted to have persistent contractures in flexion and external rotation during these 2 years. Such deformities of the hip make judgements about anteversion in infancy difficult. They also help explain the peculiarity of the lordotic, externally rotated gait seen initially in many toddlers.
