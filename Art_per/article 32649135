Abstract : An 18-year-old man with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) noted difficulty of looking forward and discomfort swallowing and breathing because of his hyperextended neck. We treated his cervical deformity with posterior spinal correction and fusion alone. He underwent a tracheotomy because of lung function deterioration 2 years after cervical surgery. The tracheotomy was performed safely because the anterior cervical spine anatomy was normalized and soft tissues around trachea were preserved by the posterior cervical correction.Cervical hyperextension can be a problem in patients with UCMD. Posterior spinal correction and fusion may be a preferable solution.
