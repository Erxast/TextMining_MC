Abstract : 31 children suffering from congenital spastic di- or quadriplegia, born between 1963-1976, were re-examined neurologically and admitted to CT. The mental level was obtained by noting the educational placement of the child. 14 patients showed normal CT patterns. In 17 patients a volume loss of the cerebral white matter with ventricular enlargement was present, but there were no local cortical defects. From similar changes on the ventricles in CT four different patterns can be ascertained. Belonging to one of these CT patterns permits no statement about the neurological and mental defect in an individual case. But massive ventricular enlargements e vacuo go hand in hand with serious neurological and mental defects.
