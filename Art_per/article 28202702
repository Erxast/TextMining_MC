Abstract : Triadin is a component of the calcium release complex of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Our objective was to analyze the skeletal muscle phenotype of the triadin knockout syndrome.We performed clinical evaluation, analyzed morphologic features by light and electron microscopy, and immunolocalized triadin in skeletal muscle.A 6-year-old boy with lifelong muscle weakness had a triadin knockout syndrome caused by compound heterozygous null mutations in triadin. Light microscopy of a deltoid muscle specimen shows multiple small abnormal spaces in all muscle fibers. Triadin immunoreactivity is absent from type 1 fibers and barely detectable in type 2 fibers. Electron microscopy reveals focally distributed dilation and degeneration of the lateral cisterns of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and loss of the triadin anchors from the preserved lateral cisterns.Absence of triadin in humans can result in a congenital myopathy associated with profound pathologic alterations in components of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Why only some triadin-deficient patients develop a skeletal muscle phenotype remains an unsolved question.
