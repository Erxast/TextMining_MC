Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital ventricular diverticulum is a very rare malformation in adults. We describe a 21-year-old male with a congenital muscular left ventricular diverticulum in the inferior wall. The lesion was suspected on two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography allowed clear detection of the diverticulum as well of mild mitral valve prolapse. The diagnosis was confirmed by cardiac catheterization. There were no other thoracoabdominal or cardiac anomalies, the patient was asymptomatic, and surgery was not deemed necessary.
