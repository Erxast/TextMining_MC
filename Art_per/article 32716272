Abstract : <b>
                        <i>Background:</i>
                    </b> Three-dimensional (3D) laparoscopic surgery in pediatrics is still uncommon and few studies assessed in clinical practice advantages and disadvantages. Applicability and effectiveness of 3D versus two-dimensional (2D) laparoscopic procedures in congenital and acquired conditions in children are still unknown. We assessed applicability and effectiveness of 3D compared with 2D laparoscopic procedures in a pediatric setting. <b>
                        <i>Methods:</i>
                    </b> Two groups of patients who underwent 3D or 2D laparoscopic surgical procedures between May 2016 and April 2018 were compared. Each 3D/2D laparoscopic procedure was assessed with a surgeon/assistant questionnaire. <b>
                        <i>Results:</i>
                    </b> The 3D group included 30 patients and the 2D group 32 patients. The analysis of the 3D/2D questionnaire showed statistically significant superiority of 3D technical aspects (<i>P</i> = .0000), allowing a better spatial orientation and depth perception, reducing manipulation and trauma to tissues. Moreover, no difference was reported in physical complaints (<i>P</i> = .7084), but decreased visual fatigue was highlighted by surgeon (<i>P</i> = .000). <b>
                        <i>Conclusions:</i>
                    </b> In pediatric patients, 3D laparoscopic procedures prove to be more effective facilitating the surgeon's performance, while maintaining the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.
