Abstract : To elucidate the protein composition of the nemaline bodies present in the muscle fibres of patients with congenital nemaline myopathy (CNM), we studied muscle biopsies with monoclonal antibodies against alpha-actinin and desmin in combination with a modified Gomori trichrome method. Electron microscopy of immunolabelled resin embedded sections was used for cytochemical localisation of alpha-actinin and desmin. Light microscopy of sections immunolabelled for alpha-actinin showed a cross-striation of the muscle fibres corresponding to the Z band pattern, focal thickening of the Z bands and additional reactivity with a granular pattern corresponding to the presence of nemaline bodies. Labelling of desmin did not show a similar pattern. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of alpha-actinin in the nemaline bodies and Z bands, whereas desmin was only found in intermediate filaments around the Z bands. Western blots showed single, sharp alpha-actinin bands indistinguishable from normal. Our results provide direct evidence for the presence of alpha-actinin in nemaline bodies and a lack of quantitative or qualitative differences between the alpha-actinin of normal and CNM muscle.
