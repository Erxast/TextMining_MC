Abstract : Maternal myasthenia gravis has been associated with the presence of neonatal myasthania and sometimes fetal congenital anomalies. The purpose of this paper is to present an infant with multiple deformations born to a mother with myasthenia gravis. The infant presented with arthrogryposis multiplex and pulmonary hypoplasia. The new born died within the first day of life. Twenty-seven other cases of neonatal myasthenia with arthrogryposis have been reported. Twenty-two of them were stillborn or died. The surviving children needed ventilatory assistance for a long period.
