Abstract : Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome (PS) is a rare mitochondrial disorder. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRCC) differ among individuals and organs, which accounts for variable clinical pictures. A subset of PS patients develop 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA-uria), but the characteristic symptoms and impaired MRCC remain unknown. Our patient, a girl, developed pancytopenia, hyperlactatemia, steatorrhea, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, Fanconi syndrome, and 3-MGA-uria. She died from cerebral hemorrhage at 3 years of age. We identified a novel 5.4-kbp deletion of mitochondrial DNA. The enzymatic activities of MRCC I and IV were markedly reduced in the liver and muscle and mildly reduced in skin fibroblasts and the heart. To date, urine organic acid analysis has been performed on 29 PS patients, including our case. Eight patients had 3-MGA-uria, while only one patient did not. The remaining 20 patients were not reported to have 3-MGA-uria. In this paper, we included these 20 patients as PS patients without 3-MGA-uria. PS patients with and without 3-MGA-uria have similar manifestations. Only a few studies have examined the enzymatic activities of MRCC.No clinical characteristics distinguish between PS patients with and without 3-MGA-uria. The correlation between 3-MGA-uria and the enzymatic activities of MRCC remains to be elucidated.• The clinical characteristics of patients with Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria remain unknown.• No clinical characteristics distinguish between Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome patients with and without 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.
