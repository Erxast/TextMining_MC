Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital is hallmarked with immobile joints and muscle fibrosis. The main objective of this study was to compare the success rate of ultrasound-guided sciatic and femoral nerve blocks with nerve stimulations in children diagnosed with distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.Sixty children aged 8 months to 2 years posted for foot surgery were randomly assigned to group NS and group US of 30 each. Under general anesthesia, femoro-sciatic block was performed with nerve stimulator guidance in group NS and ultrasound guidance in group US.Group NS: 23 of 30 (76.7%) children showed ankle movement with sciatic neurostimulation. In 7 (23.6%), distal motor response could not be elicited and the block was abandoned. Out of 23 children who could be given femoral block, in 12 (52%) patients quadriceps contractions were not elicited and fascia iliaca block was given. All 23 blocks were successful. CHIPPS score at 1, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h was 1.05 ± 0.90, 1.82 ± 1.18, 3.36 ± 1.65, 2.23 ± 2.02, and 1.18 ± 1.14, respectively. Group US: In 29 of 30 patients (96.6%), sciatic nerve was visualized with ultrasonography. All 29 children received femoral block, and they were successful. The odds of success in group US were 8.9 (95% confidence interval [1.0, 77.9]) as compared with NS group. The difference in success rate was statistically significant (P = 0.026). The analgesic duration difference in the US and NS groups was a mean 7.62 ± 0.57 h in group NS and 8.60 ± 0.66 h in group US (statistically significant [P < 0.001]). CHIPPS score at 1, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h was 0.79 ± 0.96, 1.61 ± 0.92, 2.96 ± 1.04, 2.36 ± 2.54, and 1.14 ± 1.01, respectively. The difference between the CHIPPS score was not statistically significant.Ultrasonography significantly increases the success rate of sciatic and femoral block in arthrogryposis.
