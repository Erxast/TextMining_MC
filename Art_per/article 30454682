Abstract : Protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) is a critical enzyme participating in the first step of protein O-mannosylation. Mutations in the coding gene, POMT1, have been described to be related to a series of autosomal recessive disorders associated with defective alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation, later termed muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies (MDDGs). MDDGs are characterized by a broad phenotypic spectrum of congenital muscular dystrophy or later-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, accompanied by variable degrees of intellectual disability, brain defects, and ocular abnormalities. To date, at least 76 disease-associated mutations in the POMT1 gene, including missense, nonsense, splicing, deletion, insertion/duplication, and insertion-deletion mutations, have been reported in the literature. In this review, we highlight the present knowledge of the identified disease-associated POMT1 gene mutations and genetic animal models related to the POMT1 gene. This review may help further normative classification of phenotypes, assist in definite clinical and genetic diagnoses, and genetic counseling, and may comprehensively improve our understanding of the basis of complex phenotypes and possible pathogenic mechanisms involved.
