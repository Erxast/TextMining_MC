Title : Congenital fusion of the maxilla and mandible: brief case report.
Date : 2006
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital fusion of the mandible and maxilla is a rare anomaly usually seen in association with various syndromes. Reports of isolated cases of bony fusion of the jaws are sparse. Only 10 reported cases were found in the literature search. Maxillomandibular fusion restricts mouth opening, causing feeding problems and difficulties in swallowing, respiration, growth, and development, and thus must be treated early. We report a case of congenital fusion of the mandible and maxilla in a 1-year-old boy and describe the clinical features of this anomaly to add to the existing literature on the subject. This is our second encounter of such a case.
