Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Indications and considerations for reconstruction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) differ between growing and skeletally mature patients. Osteoarthritis, which is the most common cause of TMJ destruction in adults, is comparatively rare in children. The most common indications in young patients are congenital deformities, pathology, ankylosis and progressive resorptive processes. Options for reconstruction include distraction osteogenesis, autologous reconstruction (ie, costochondral graft, free fibula flap), and total alloplastic joint replacement. The choice of the ideal reconstruction is based on multiple factors, which include extent and laterality of the deformity, patient age, jaw growth pattern, and potential for progressive destruction.
