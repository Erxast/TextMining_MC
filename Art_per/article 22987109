Abstract : Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a common congenital heart defect in children. Perimembranous VSD (Pm VSD), a defect involving the membranous septum and the adjacent portion of the muscular septum, accounts for about 70 % of cases. Transcatheter closure of Pm VSDs using the Amplatzer Pm VSD device, although successful in many patients, has been associated with major adverse events. Complete heart block, thromboembolism, and new-onset valvular regurgitations in patients undergoing VSD closure using the Pm VSD occluder have been reported [3]. Recently, a new retrograde approach for transcatheter closure of Pm VSDs using the Amplatzer Duct Occluder II (ADO II) has been described with a 90 % success rate [1]. This report describes a child who had multiple Pm VSDs with septal aneurysm undergoing successful transcatheter closure using two ADO II occluders with relative ease.
