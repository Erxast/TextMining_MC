Title : Congenital inflammatory myopathy.
Date : 1990
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We present 3 patients with congenital inflammatory myopathy and summarize the literature. CNS involvement (microcephaly/intellectual delay) may or may not be present. Serum creatine kinase activity is elevated, the EMG is myopathic, and the muscle biopsy reveals inflammatory infiltrates, muscle fiber damage, and class I major histocompatibility complex products in muscle sarcolemma. Possible etiologies include intrauterine viral infection or an autoimmune process. Treatment with steroids may result in some motor improvement but has no effect on the CNS involvement. Despite a common time of presentation, these patients have a heterogeneous clinical profile, often suggesting a congenital muscular dystrophy syndrome.
