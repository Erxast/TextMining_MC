Title : Respiratory involvement in primary muscle disorders: assessment and management.
Date : 1993
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Eighty-four patients with primary disorders of muscle were referred for assessment of respiratory insufficiency between 1978 and 1991. The eventual diagnoses were: 'limb girdle syndromes' (18 patients), adult onset acid maltase deficiency (14), dystrophia myotonica (13), inflammatory disorders (10), congenital myopathies (nine), rigid spine syndromes (five), dystrophies (Duchenne (six), facioscapulohumeral (four), Becker (one)) and miscellaneous (four). Presentations were often insidious, with progressive nocturnal hypoventilation culminating in respiratory failure or arrest, recurrent respiratory tract infections, or obstructive sleep apnoea. Respiratory symptoms developed relatively early in patients with acid maltase deficiency and inflammatory disorders but parallelled the development of limb weakness in limb girdle, myotonic and congenital syndromes. Sixty-six patients received respiratory support for a median of 5 years (1-34 years) using various techniques of negative and positive pressure ventilation. Fourteen patients received short-term support for an episode of respiratory failure before being weaned, 51 required nocturnal domiciliary ventilation and one was dependent on continuous domiciliary support. Tracheostomy was performed in 32 patients and used for domiciliary nocturnal ventilation in 25. Twenty-eight patients have subsequently died.
