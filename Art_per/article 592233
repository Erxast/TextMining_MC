Abstract : Arthrogryphosis, a disease of unknown nature, is accompanied by radiological manifestations which involve essentially the limbs and spine. A distribution involving all four limbs is the most common. The commonest radiological abnormalities are equinovarus clubfoot, clubhand in ulnar deviation, scoliosis and dislocation of the hip. The radiologist examines such children in order to assess the extent of their disease and follow such orthopaedic problems as they may develop.
