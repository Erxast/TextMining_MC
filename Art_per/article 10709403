Abstract : Congenital muscular torticollis is a condition of debatable aetiology and management. Untreated, cervical function and facial cosmesis may be severely compromised. The aim of this study was to establish the epidemiology, presentation and management of congenital muscular torticollis in Singapore.Ninety-one patients with torticollis were seen at the National University Hospital (NUH) from January 1994 to December 1997. Torticollis was first noted at a median age of 2 months with the median age of presentation being 6 months. At presentation, a sternomastoid tumour was noted in 33 patients and 62 patients had facial asymmetry. Thirteen of 22 patients with neonatal records available had mandibular hypoplasia at birth on the side where the sternomastoid was affected. Half of the patients (45) had a right sided lesion, with 46 being left sided. The rates of assisted breech delivery, instrumental deliveries (forceps and vacuum) and Caesarean section were higher in the study group. Nine (59.1%) of 13 patients with vertex presentation, had a lesion on the side of the presenting shoulder. Forty-eight of 72 patients responded well to therapy with improvement; 20 underwent surgery and the median age of presentation of 19.5 months in this group was significantly later than that of 4 months in the group which responded to physiotherapy alone.Birth trauma appears to be the main aetiological factor in congenital muscular torticollis. Patients generally respond well to physiotherapy. This study revealed 2 findings hitherto unreported: (1) mandibular hypoplasia may be an useful early sign of this condition, and (2) the side affected may depend on the side of shoulder delivered first. More studies, however, are required to confirm these findings.
