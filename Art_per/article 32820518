Abstract : To analyze the clinical and molecular characteristics of a child with very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD).Peripheral blood sample of the patient was collected for the extraction of genomic DNA. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was carried out for the proband. Suspected mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing.The patient, a 12-month-old girl, was admitted for diarrhea, vomiting, fever, poor spirit and decreased blood pressure. During the course of the disease, she also manifested hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, elevated myocardial enzyme kinase, fever and metabolic acidosis, and had died after three days due to ventricular tachycardia and respiratory failure. Genetic testing showed that she has carried heterozygous mutations of of the ACADVL gene, namely c.664G>A (exon 8) and c.1056_1057del (exon 10). Blood screening for metabolic genetic diseases showed increased C12, C14, C16, C18, C14:1, C14:2, C16:1, C4/C3 and C8/C3, accompanied with decreased C0, C0/C16 and C8/C10. VLCADD and secondary carnitine deficiency could not be excluded, which was in keeping with the result of genetic testing.The child was diagnosed with VLCADD, which may be attributed to the compound heterozygous c.664G>A and c.1056_1057del variants of the ACADVL gene.
