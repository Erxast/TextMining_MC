Title : Why are there no proven therapies for genetic mitochondrial diseases?
Date : 2011
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Although mitochondrial disease research in general is robust, adequate treatment of these life-threatening conditions has lagged, partly because of a persistence of clinical anecdotes as substitutes for scientifically and ethically rigorous clinical trials. Here I summarize the key lessons learned from some of the "first generation" of randomized controlled trials for genetic mitochondrial diseases and suggest how future trials may benefit from both past experience and exciting new resources available for patient-oriented research and training in this field.
