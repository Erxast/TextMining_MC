Abstract : The case of a newborn presenting from birth with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita resting mainly on the legs, severe hypotonia, consciousness anomalies, clonic fits, recurrent apnea and bradycardia, absent sucking and swallowing is described. At the age 4 months a further episode of apnea and bradycardia was followed by death. The neuropathologic analysis disclosed a number of bilateral, cystic and symmetric infarcts in the thalamus and hypothalamus, spreading caudally to the tegmentum of the mesencephalon and the pons. Such distribution of lesions does suggest a vascular topography, i.e. in the territories supplied by branches of the vertebro-basilar arteries. There was light clinical and neuropathological evidence of prenatal occurrence of the vascular injuries, possibly at the end of the 7th month by a defective arterial perfusion of the fetus due to protracted menaces of premature birth. We would outline the existence and frequency of the thalamic and dorsal brain stem necrotic involvement by acute anoxia-ischemia occurring in the third trimester of gestation or at birth, and the relative peculiarity of their clinical picture.
