Abstract : Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, neuropathy, and deafness (NEDHND, OMIM #617519) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in SPTBN4 coding for type 4 βIV-spectrin, a non-erythrocytic member of the β-spectrin family. Variants in SPTBN4 disrupt the cytoskeletal machinery that controls proper localization of ion channels and the function of axonal domains, thereby generating severe neurological dysfunction. We set out to analyze the genetic causes and describe the clinical spectrum of suspected cases of NEDHND. Variant screening was done by whole exome sequencing; clinical phenotypes were described according to the human phenotype ontology, and histochemical analysis was performed with disease-specific antibodies. We report four families with five patients harboring novel homozygous and compound heterozygous SPTBN4 variants, amongst them a multi-exon deletion of SPTBN4. All patients presented with the key features of NEDHND; severe muscular hypotonia, dysphagia, absent speech, gross motor, and mental retardation. Additional symptoms comprised horizontal nystagmus, epileptiform discharges in EEG without manifest seizures, and choreoathetosis. Muscle histology revealed both characteristics of myopathy and of neuropathy. This report expands the SPTBN4 variant spectrum, highlights the spectrum of morphological phenotypes of NEDHND-patients, and reveals clinical similarities between the NEDHND, non-5q SMA, and congenital myopathies.
