Abstract : A hitherto unknown skeletal muscle disorder is described in six Braunvieh x Brown Swiss calves. The animals showed rapidly progressing muscular weakness and became recumbent within 2 weeks of birth. Histological examination of skeletal muscle revealed a marked variation in muscle fibre size, internally placed nuclei, segmental loss of cross-striation with disorganization of myofibrils, and accumulation of nemaline rods. The most distinctive histological finding was intracytoplasmic, homogeneous, mostly crescent-shaped areas at the periphery of numerous muscle fibres. Electron microscopically, accumulations of tightly packed, parallel filamentous structures, about 20 nm in diameter, were detected in these areas. Enzyme histochemistry showed that all muscle fibre types were affected. Vimentin and dystrophin immunohistochemistry revealed normal antigen distribution within connective tissue components and at the periphery of each muscle fibre, respectively. The lesions could be readily distinguished from other neurological and neuromuscular disorders previously described in Braunvieh x Brown Swiss or American Brown Swiss Cattle. The disease appears to be a novel congenital myopathy in this breed, and a hereditary aetiology is suspected.
