Abstract : Skeletal muscle development and regeneration are tightly regulated processes. How the intracellular organization of muscle fibers is achieved during these steps is unclear. Here, we focus on the cellular and physiological roles of amphiphysin 2 (BIN1), a membrane remodeling protein mutated in both congenital and adult centronuclear myopathies (CNM), that is ubiquitously expressed and has skeletal muscle-specific isoforms. We created and characterized constitutive muscle-specific and inducible <i>Bin1</i> homozygous and heterozygous knockout mice targeting either ubiquitous or muscle-specific isoforms. Constitutive <i>Bin1</i>-deficient mice died at birth from lack of feeding due to a skeletal muscle defect. T-tubules and other organelles were misplaced and altered, supporting a general early role for BIN1 in intracellular organization, in addition to membrane remodeling. Although restricted deletion of <i>Bin1</i> in unchallenged adult muscles had no impact, the forced switch from the muscle-specific isoforms to the ubiquitous isoforms through deletion of the in-frame muscle-specific exon delayed muscle regeneration. Thus, ubiquitous BIN1 function is necessary for muscle development and function, whereas its muscle-specific isoforms fine tune muscle regeneration in adulthood, supporting that BIN1 CNM with congenital onset are due to developmental defects, whereas later onset may be due to regeneration defects.
