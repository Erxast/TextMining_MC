Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Posterior subluxation of the glenohumeral joint and a posterior, winged scapular deformity have been reported in a patient with congenital contracture of the infraspinous muscle. The present case was successfully treated by resection of the contracted band within the infraspinous muscle, glenoid osteotomy, reverse Putti-Platt, and resection of the protruding part of the scapula. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported of congenital contracture of the infraspinous muscle. The pathogenesis of the deformity in this case is discussed.
