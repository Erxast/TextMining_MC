Abstract : Most types of neuromuscular diseases are known to be associated with a high risk of sleep-disordered breathing. We performed a prospective study in a well individualized group of muscular disorders, congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD), to characterize the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing and thereby to determine the potential usefulness of sleep studies in such patients.Twenty CMD children (12 F, 8 M, aged 4-17 years) were included. Using overnight polysomnography, we determined the following parameters: sleep stages, sleep latency, sleep efficiency index, wake time duration, total sleep time (TST), apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), arterial blood oxygen saturation, and nocturnal paroxysmal EEG activity.As compared to healthy controls, we detected in our study group frequent awakenings, a decreased TST (mean 448 ± 44.4 min) and a decreased REM duration (mean 11.5 ± 3.5% of TST). Significant increase in wake time duration (28-90 min) and decrease in REM duration were observed in 12 patients. An apnea/hypopnea syndrome was detected in 13 patients (65%) with central apneas in 8, obstructive apneas in 2 and 3 mixed apneas in 3 patients. AHI was >10 in 3 cases, <10> 5 in 4 cases and were concomitant with blood oxygen de-saturation in four cases. NPA were detected in 10 patients ranging from 10 to 40% of TST.Our results confirm the high incidence of sleep disordered breathing in children with CMD, and thereby, the usefulness of overnight polysomnography recordings in such patients.
