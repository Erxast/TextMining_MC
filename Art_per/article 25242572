Abstract : A 3-month-old infant was found dead in his bed. A postmortem computed tomography (CT) scan suggested fatty attenuation in the liver parenchyma, but no other potentially fatal changes were found. To clarify the cause of death, a medicolegal autopsy was carried out.Internal examination confirmed the presence of liver steatosis as well as hepatomegaly. There were no other significant findings including encephalitis or brain edema.To clarify the mechanism underlying lipid accumulation in the liver, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) analysis was conducted. This indicated a significant accumulation of C14:1 acylcarnitine in the liver of the deceased, suggesting very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency.To find the cause of the VLCAD deficiency, genetic analysis of the responsible gene, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very long chain (ACADVL), was performed. This revealed two novel mutations that may have accounted for the disease.A combination of these data revealed that the liver steatosis in this case might have been caused by VLCAD deficiency based on genetic mutations of ACADVL. Thus, the deceased might have been vulnerable to energy crisis and sudden infant death. The present findings show that MALDI-IMS analysis as well as genetic analysis can be useful for elucidating the cause of death.
