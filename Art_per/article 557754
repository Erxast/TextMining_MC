Abstract : An infant born with severe but nonprogressive somatic and cranial muscle weakness including bilateral external ophthalmoplegia was studied with a motor-point muscle biopsy. There was a strinking generalized decrease in the size of muscle fibers (hypotrophy), most marked in the type I fibers. Many of the small fibers were immature, resembling myotubes. Neuromuscular junctions on severely hypotrophic fibers were normal with esterase staining and by ultrastructural criteria. Although these are unusual clinical and biopsy characteristics, this infant's condition bears a resemblance to two other congenital nonprogressive neuromuscular diseases:myotubular myopathy and congenital fiber type disproportion. In these conditions and in our patient, there is no primary degenerative process affecting nerve or muscle but, rather, an apparent lack of maturation of fetal muscle fibers, indicating a defective normal trophic interaction between nerve and muscle.
