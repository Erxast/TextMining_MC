Abstract : We describe a father and daughter with a rigid spine syndrome and proximal myopathy. The index patient was a 42-year-old man, who died from respiratory failure after a lifelong, slowly progressive proximal myopathy and a rigid spine phenotype. This was morphologically characterized by cytoplasmic bodies, increased desmin, features of reducing-body myopathy, and sarcoplasmic and intranuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions. These cases are characterized by an early onset and possibly autosomal-dominant inheritance, with associated complex structural hallmarks of both desmin-related and inclusion body myopathies. Together they may be defined as a complex mixed congenital myopathy with a rigid spine phenotype.
