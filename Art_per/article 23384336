Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy is classified as one of the myotonic syndromes although myotonia is only a minor characteristic of it. It is, in fact, also a multisystem disease with cardiac, digestive, ocular, and endocrine abnormalities. Two subgroups are currently identified with many similarities: DM1 refers to classic dystrophia myotonica (Steinert disease), while DM2, formerly called proximal myotonic myopathy has a later onset. The congenital form is present only in DM1. The genetic causes of DM1 and 2 are different but end up in a similar way of altering RNAm processing and splicing of other genes. The anesthetic risk is increased in case of DM1 type. This review summarizes current knowledge concerning the pathophysiology and anesthetic management of this disease in children and adults.
