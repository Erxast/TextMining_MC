Abstract : In the case of camptodactylia, the early congenital form must be differentiated from that encountered in adolescents. Mild abnormalities with limitation of extension up to 30 degeees do not need treatment. Those with limitation of 30-50 degrees can be treated conservatively with suitable splints. With increasing failure of contraction, when there is a family history, or an obvious contracture, the operative procedure must be adjusted to the individual case and the balance between flexor and extensors of the fingers must be re-established. With suitable operative technique, definite improvement can be achieved, even if a complete correction of the deformity cannot always be obtained.
