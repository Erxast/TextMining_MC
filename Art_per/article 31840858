Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Cutaneous smooth muscle hamartoma is an uncommon, benign tumor developing in the dermis as a result of disorganized hyperproliferation of arrector pili muscle fibers. We present a 1-month-old infant with a congenital smooth muscle hamartoma together with the dermoscopic findings of the case. Dermoscopy can be a helpful non-invasive tool in diagnosing congenital smooth muscle hamartoma due to its distinct findings that help to differentiate it from close mimickers like solitary mastocytoma.
