Title : Management of advanced foot deformities in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
Date : 1988
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Treatment for the characteristic hand deformities of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa has been well described in the literature. We present our first experience delineating the surgical treatment for advanced foot deformities in this disease. This case emphasizes the need for release of contractures, the use of split-thickness skin grafts, and the need for rigid fixation to maintain surgical correction until healing is complete.
