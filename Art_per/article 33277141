Abstract : Marked decreases in serum creatine kinase levels have been noted in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies as rare complications of autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases.The influence of systemic inflammation on serum creatine kinase levels was reviewed from the charts of three subjects with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy.A total of 30 infectious events were identified. Elevated serum C-reactive protein levels coincided with decreased creatine kinase levels on 19 occasions. In one subject, administration of 2Â mg/kg/d prednisolone for bronchial asthma resulted in a decrease in creatine kinase level on six other occasions.Apart from an increase in endogenous cortisol secretion, certain inflammation-related molecules could play a role in mitigating muscle cell damage in Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy during febrile infectious episodes. Corticosteroids may be a promising agent for the treatment of muscular symptoms in this disorder.
