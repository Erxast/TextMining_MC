Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is characterized by congenital skeletal anomalies and progressive heterotopic ossification. We present a 4 year old male patient who underwent unnecessary harmful multiple biopsies before the diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is made. Though rare, diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva should be considered whenever characteristic radiographic features of multifocal heterotopic bone formation is seen along with the valgus deformities of the big toes.
