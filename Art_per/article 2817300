Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) is a heterogenous group of disorders. In the majority of cases the intelligence is preserved, which comprises the classic "occidental" (type 1) form. This type appears to be prevalent in the west. We report a five-case series in Turkey, confirming its geographical distribution.
