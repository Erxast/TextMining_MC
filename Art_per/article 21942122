Abstract : Twenty-six patients (12 males and 14 females) between two days and 41 years old with temporomandibular joint ankylosis were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-three joints were involved; 19 unilateral and six bilateral. The aetiologies were trauma, 69.2%; infection, 15.4%; unknown, 11.5% and congenital, 3.9. The majority, 31 were intracapsular while the remaining two joints were extracapsular 51.6% were limited to the condyle, 32.2% extended to the coronoid process and the zygomatic, 9.7% extended to the sigmoid notch while the remaining 6.5% had maxillomandibular fusion. Tracheostomy (48%) was the most common mode of intubation. Gap arthroplasty was carried out in 20 joints while 11 joints had interposition arthroplasty. Postoperative complications were seven anterior open bite, three facial nerve weakness, three infections and two recurrences.
