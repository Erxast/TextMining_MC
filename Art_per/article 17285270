Abstract : The contracture of the deltoid muscle is an uncommon disorder. Amongst the various causes reported, post intramuscular injection and trauma leading to the fibrosis of the muscle are common. However, congenital cases are extremely rare. We report a case of congenital progressive bilateral abduction contracture left untreated for a long time leading to anteroinferior subluxation. A proximal release was performed with satisfactory outcome on both sides.
