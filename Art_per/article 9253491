Abstract : A 12-month-old girl with delayed developmental milestones, due to muscle hypotonia and weakness from early infancy, exhibited type 2 fiber hypoplasia. A muscle biopsy specimen disclosed type 1 fiber predominance and type 2B fiber deficiency compatible with congenital myopathy. During the following 4 years, she continued to have mild muscle weakness, but no mental retardation. Her mother had similar symptoms from early infancy with minimal progression. Although type 2 fiber hypoplasia is a non-specific finding in various diseases, it may be a specific finding in a limited number of patients with hereditary congenital non-progressive myopathy.
