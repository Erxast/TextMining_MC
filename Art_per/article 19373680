Abstract : A 6-month-old boy presented with a congenital eye movement disorder consistent with congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1). Mutational analysis confirmed the most common mutation in the CFEOM1 gene KIF21A. In addition to the typical findings in CFEOM1, distinctive conjunctival changes and small bilateral optic disc colobomata were also noted. It is suggested that optic disc colobomata represent a new association of CFEOM1.
