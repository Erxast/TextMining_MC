Abstract : To present the effectiveness of passive stretching as a treatment for camptodactyly, without any other form of physiotherapy or splinting.From May 2003 to August 2008, 61 digits of 22 patients were treated conservatively using passive stretching exercises. All children were less than 3 years old and had no other anomalies. Flexion contractures before and after treatment in mild, moderate, and severe groups were measured and changes were analyzed statistically. The correlations between various clinical factors and treatment outcome were also analyzed statistically. The average follow-up period was 26 months (range, 12-47 mo).Mean flexion contracture improved from 20° to 1° in the mild group (p < .001), from 39° to 12° in the moderate group (p < .001), and from 75° to 28° in the severe group (p < .001). Of the clinical factors examined, only initial flexion contracture was found to be significantly correlated with treatment outcome (r = -0.287, p = .0025).Passive stretching can effectively improve flexion deformity in camptodactyly in infants and young children.Therapeutic IV.
