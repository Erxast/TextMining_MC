Abstract : A 2-day-old poodle puppy was seen to have hypoplastic and arthrogrypotic hindlimbs and no tail. Palpation revealed an absence of lumbar and sacral vertebrae. At necropsy examination, the colon had a blind ending at the umbilical area, there were no urinary system organs, the spinal cord ended at the thoracic level and no genital system organs were found except for a structure similar to a rudimentary penis. The pelvis was abnormal with no articulation with the spine. This congenital anomaly was consistent with perosomus elumbis, a rare condition of unknown aetiology with few reported cases.
