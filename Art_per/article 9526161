Title : Spastic hemiplegia of the upper extremity in children.
Date : 1998
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Care of upper extremity problems in hemiplegic children requires careful evaluation and planning. This article focuses on the evaluation and treatment of spastic hemiplegia attributable to cerebral palsy. All treatments must take into consideration the level of static and dynamic motor deformity; levels of discriminatory sensibility, intelligence, and motivation; and overall level of function. The treatments discussed are designed to improve the child's musculoskeletal condition but do not cure the underlying disease.
