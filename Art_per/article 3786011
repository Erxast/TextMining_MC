Title : Orthopedic problems of the shoulder and neck.
Date : 1986
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : If one excludes trauma, problems of the neck and shoulder in children are relatively uncommon. Still, the pediatrician or family practitioner should have sufficient familiarity to provide the family with appropriate counseling and referral. This article emphasizes the common problems, but also notes less common conditions that, if unrecognized, may have serious impact on the health and well-being of the child.
