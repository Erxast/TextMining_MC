Abstract : For this study, cases involving 41 patients with 57 congenital trigger digit were reviewed. Two of these digits were seen when the patient was very young. However, most "congenital" trigger digits present sometime after the neonatal period. A clear difference exists between trigger thumbs and trigger fingers. In this series, thumbs were more frequently affected; 10 were bilateral, and none resolved spontaneously. Fingers were less frequently affected, and two of them recovered without operation. All 39 children had an operative release of the A1 pulley of the flexor tendon sheath, with excellent results.
