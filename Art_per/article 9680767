Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy, the most common inherited neuromuscular disease, is an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy characterized by myotonia and distal muscle weakness. It is caused by an increase in the number of cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) nucleotide repeats present on the long arm of chromosome 19. Two patients were evaluated, one with classic adult-onset myotonic dystrophy and the other with congenital myotonic dystrophy. Contrasts in the clinical features and genetic transmission of this disease and clinical management are reviewed.
