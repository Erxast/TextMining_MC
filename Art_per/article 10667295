Date : 1999
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The purpose of this study is to describe two infants that were diagnosed with Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), a rare form of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). They were studied in their clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiologic features. The index case had a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the second patient had a head computerized tomography (CT). In addition, a literature review was performed to describe the main forms of CMD. The index case fulfilled all criteria for WWS. A brain MRI performed at age 4 months served to corroborate the clinical diagnosis, showing severe hydrocephalus, type II lissencephaly, cerebellar vermian aplasia, and a hypoplastic brain stem. The authors were able to establish a retrospective diagnosis of WWS in the index case's older sister, based upon her clinical picture and head CT report.
