Abstract : Our aim was to conduct a comparative study in a large cohort of myopathic patients carrying LMNA gene mutations to evaluate clinical and molecular features associated with different phenotypes.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 78 myopathic patients with LMNA mutation and 30 familial cases with LMNA mutation without muscle involvement. We analyzed features characterizing the various forms of LMNA-related myopathy through correlation statistics.Of the 78 patients, 37 (47%) had limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1B (LGMD1B), 18 (23%) congenital muscular dystrophy (MDCL), 17 (22%) autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 2 (EDMD2), and 6 (8%) an atypical myopathy. The myopathic phenotypes shared a similar cardiac impairment. Cardioverter defibrillator or pacemaker was implanted in 41 (53%) myopathic patients compared to 7 (23%) familial cases without muscle involvement (p = 0.005). Heart transplantation was performed in 8 (10.3%) myopathic patients and in none of the familial cases. Ten (12.8%) myopathic patients died; there were no deaths among the familial cases (p = 0.032). Missense mutations were found in 14 patients (82%) with EDMD2 and 14 patients (78%) with MDCL compared to 17 patients (45%) with LGMD1B and 4 (67%) atypical patients. Frameshift mutations were detected in 17 (45%) LGMD1B compared to 3 (18%) EDMD2, 1 (6%) MDCL, and 2 (33%) with atypical myopathy (p = 0.021). Furthermore, frameshift mutations were found in 30 of 73 patients (41%) with heart involvement compared to 4 of 35 (11%) without heart involvement (p = 0.004).Our data provided new insights in LMNA-related myopathies, whose natural history appears to be dominated by cardiac involvement and related complications.
