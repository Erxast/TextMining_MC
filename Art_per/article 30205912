Abstract : The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, localization, and width of the foramen of Huschke (FH) and the relationship between age and FH. Another aim was to investigate the development of spontaneous temporomandibular joint (TMJ) herniation. This was a retrospective review of high-resolution computed tomography images of the temporal bone of 1025 patients. The prevalence of FH and the axial and sagittal diameters of the foramen were evaluated. Cases were found in which the TMJ had herniated through FH into the EAC. FH was detected in 137 (13.4%) of 1025 patients. The prevalence of FH was higher in females (18.4%) than in males (6.6%) (P<0.001). The presence of FH increased with age (P=0.005). Herniation of the TMJ through FH into the EAC was seen in four patients (0.4%), and 2.9% of patients with FH detected had TMJ herniation into the EAC. As well as being congenital, FH can also be senile; the prevalence may increase with age. Herniation of the TMJ through FH into the EAC is very rare; this was observed in 0.4% of all patients and 2.9% of patients with FH detected.
