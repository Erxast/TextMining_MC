Abstract : A young man was found to have multiple synostosis syndrome type I after presenting with a neck injury causing a cervical spinal cord contusion. Neurological symptoms and signs suggested spinal cord compression. Magnetic resonance (MR) and computerized tomography (CT) imaging of the spine showed spinal canal stenosis with cord compression at C3-C6, a deformed spinal canal flattened in the anteroposterior dimension, vertebral fusions and deformed lateral processes of the vertebrae. He had a long broad nose with hypoplasia of the alae nasi, conductive hearing loss requiring hearing aids, muscular build, stiff spine, prominent acromia, pectus excavatum, ischial prominences, short fifth fingers, fusion at the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fifth fingers with indistinct overlying creases, and toe syndactyly. Spinal cord stenosis is a serious complication of multiple synostosis syndrome, that should be kept in mind in considering the risk of neck or back injury associated with certain sports or other activities. In both the multiple synostosis syndrome and the less severe proximal symphalangism deafness syndrome, mutations have been detected in the human homologue of the noggin gene on chromosome 17q21-q22.
