Abstract : In 1973, Singleton and Merten described a new syndrome in 2 female probands with aortic and cardiac valve calcifications, early loss of secondary dentition, and widened medullary cavities of the phalanges. In 1984, Aicardi and Goutières defined a phenotype resembling congenital viral infection with basal ganglia calcification and increased protein content in the cerebrospinal fluid. Between 2006 and 2012, mutations in 6 different genes were described to be associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, specifically-TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, ADAR, and SAMHD1. More recently, mutations in IFIH1 were reported in a variety of neuroimmunological phenotypes, including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, while a specific Arg822Gln mutation in IFIH1 was described in 3 discrete families with Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS). IFIH1 encodes for melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and all mutations identified to date have been associated with an enhanced interferon response in affected individuals. In this study, we present a male child demonstrating recurrent febrile episodes, spasticity, and basal ganglia calcification suggestive of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, who carries the same Arg822Gln mutation in IFIH1 previously associated with SMS. We conclude that both diseases are part of the interferonopathy grouping and that the Arg822Gln mutation in IFIH1 can cause a spectrum of disease, including neurological involvement.
