Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Antecubital pterygium is rare in the nail-patella syndrome but common in the multiple pterygium syndrome and aplasia of the trochlea. It is known that there is the rebound phenomenon after treatment of congenital joint contracture. We describe the poor functional results due to rapid recurrence of the flexion contracture treated with the Ilizarov method for an antecubital pterygium in the nail-patella syndrome.
