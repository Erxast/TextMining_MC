Abstract : LGMD1D is an autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy caused by variants in the DNAJB6 gene. This is typically an adult-onset disorder characterized by moderately progressive proximal muscle weakness without respiratory or bulbar involvement; however phenotypic variability is often observed with some individuals having earlier onset and more severe symptoms. Here, we present a family with a novel NM_005494.2:c.271T > G p.(Phe91Val) variant in DNAJB6 with a late-onset, mild and slowly progressive form of the disease, including one individual, who in her 7th decade of life has subclinical LGMD1D with only mild features on muscle biopsy and MRI. Unlike previously reported cases where missense variants affecting the Phe91 amino acid residue are associated with a more severe form of the disease, this family represents the mild end of the LGMD1D clinical spectrum. Therefore, this family adds further complexity to the genotype-phenotype correlation in DNAJB6-associated muscular dystrophies.
