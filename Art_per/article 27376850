Title : The vaginal vestibule: assessing the case for an anterior and posterior division.
Date : 2017
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The vaginal vestibule has not been the subject of a dedicated journal article. Recent terminology has suggested its division into anterior and posterior components. The case for this division has not yet been assessed. Both components extend laterally from the hymen to the junction with the labia minora. The posterior vaginal vestibule is proposed to extend from the posterior aspect of the hymen to the anterior edge of the perineum whilst the anterior vestibule extends from the posterior aspect of the hymen to just below the clitoris. Anatomical considerations (differing layers) might firstly support the above division. The posterior vestibule, by necessity, is far more flexible with the superficial aspect (approximately 1.5 cm), anatomically and histologically, comprising skin and subcutaneous tissue, with perineal musculature deep to this. In turn, it is more likely to be subject to obstetric and surgical considerations than the anterior vaginal vestibule. Obstetric trauma, in particular, would tend to create defects, particularly at its posterior margin. Many dermatological and microbiological considerations may be common to both anterior and posterior vestibule. Any dermatological condition of the vestibule can result in sexual dysfunction and can be complicated by secondary muscular spasm. Congenital anomalies will differ anteriorly and posteriorly. Multiple considerations can be identified to support the case for division of the vaginal vestibule into anterior and posterior components. Neurourol.
