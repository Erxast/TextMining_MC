Title : [Multiple congenital arthrogryposis as a cause of learning and communicating problems].
Date : 1976 Jan-Feb
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Since 1963, the authors have studied 83 cases of multiple arthrogryposis. Incidence at Hospital de Pediatria was 0.006%. It was shown that clinicians usually pay attention only to osteoarticular problems and very little attention to neurological problems. A new classification of arthrogryposis is proposed, including learning and communication problems with the aim of providing means for the study of the disease under a multidisciplinary approach.
