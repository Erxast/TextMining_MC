Abstract : Oblique facial clefts are extremely rare congenital deformities with a reported incidence of 0.24% of all facial clefts. This report presents a patient with a right-sided oblique cleft extending through the upper lip, the alar groove and the lower palpebra accompanied by a left-sided complete cleft lip and palate. Hypertylorism and bilateral microphthalmia as well as flexion wrist contractures were also present. Primary straight-line closure of the oblique cleft was undertaken followed by primary closure of the contralateral cleft lip. The treatment modality and 2 year follow-up results are presented.
