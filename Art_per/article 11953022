Abstract : Prenatal transplantation of stem cells is an exciting frontier for the treatment of many congenital diseases. The fetus may be an ideal recipient for stem cells, as it is immunologically immature and has rapidly proliferating cellular compartments that may support the engraftment of transplanted cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), given their ability to differentiate among multiple lineages, could potentially be used to treat diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta, muscular dystrophy, and a variety of others that can be diagnosed in utero. We have shown, using a human-sheep in utero xenotransplantation model, that human MSC have the ability to engraft, differentiate into many tissue types, and survive for over 1 year in fetal lamb recipients. This observation warrants further studies of the behavior of MSC following systemic or site-directed transplantation.
