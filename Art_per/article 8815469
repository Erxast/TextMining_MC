Abstract : We report the case of a 29-year-old woman with congenital myotony who underwent cesarean section under intradural anesthesia with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine plus fentanyl. We describe the behavior of the anesthetic used as well as the implications this condition has for the anesthesiologist.
