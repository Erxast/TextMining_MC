Abstract : The triple osteotomy of the innominate bone is a total redirectional reconstruction and is obtained by circum-acetabular osteotomies through the ilium, ischium and pubis. The method achieves coverage of a dislocated or subluxated femoral head where other iliac osteotomies are ineffective or incomplete. Triple osteotomy was performed on 175 hips including 121 congenital dislocation-subluxations. The patients' ages ranged from 6 to 35, with 70 per cent falling between 9 and 12. Eighty-six per cent had a satisfactory result. Most of the unsatisfactory results were in cerebral palsy, myelodysplasia and peroneal muscular atrophy and associated with uncontrolled muscle contractures or progressive disease.
