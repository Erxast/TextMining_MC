Abstract : Bag3opathy is a rare myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) caused by a mutation in the Bcl-2 associated-athanogene-3 gene. Less than twenty patients have been described, almost all with severe cardiac involvement. We present a 26-year-old man with a c.626C>T (p.Pro209Leu) mutation in the Bcl-2 associated-athanogene-3 gene (BAG3). Our patient presented with problems running before he turned 10 and rapidly progressing, proximal muscle weakness and rigidity of the neck and back. Muscle biopsy showed Z-disc streaming, vacuoles, which is typical findings of Bag3opathy, as well as accumulation of filamentous materials. He rapidly developed respiratory insufficiency necessitating assisted ventilation, and became wheelchair bound by age 13. The progression of his muscle disease is characteristic of Bag3opathy, but unlike other reported cases, he had no evidence of cardiac involvement at age 25 years, despite serial Holter monitoring, ECG and echocardiographs. This case illustrates that counseling of patients with BAG3 myopathy should not predict an inevitable occurrence of cardiomyopathy.
