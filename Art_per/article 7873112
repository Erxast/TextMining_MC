Abstract : To ascertain the patients' perception of the consequences of elbow flexion contractures and better understand the circumstances at their inception, we surveyed 405 spinal muscular atrophy and congenital myopathy patients. Diagrams of various elbow angles and questions concerning the effect of elbow contractures on daily activities were part of the survey. Of 108 completed responses, effectively a 24% response rate, 49 reported elbow flexion contractures. Thirteen of the 49 patients reported first noting them during extended periods of inactivity. Elbow flexion contractures greater than 25 degrees were intractable and were reported to hamper 17% (77 of 410) of specifically considered daily activities for the 49 subjects. Twenty-nine of the 49 (59%) subjects with contractures complained of contracture-associated hindrance of at least one daily function. Perceived contracture-associated difficulties increased significantly as a function of contracture severity. Elbow contractures were perceived to be useful by 12% of the respondents. The correlation between contracture severity and upper limb discomfort was also striking. We conclude that elbow flexion contractures are common and perceived to be associated with disability and discomfort for about one-half of spinal muscular atrophy and congenital myopathy patients.
