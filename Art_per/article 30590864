Abstract : A 7-week-old Labrador retriever presented for further investigation into acute onset regurgitation, following weaning from liquid to solid food. A videofluoroscopic swallow study demonstrated a severe, focal esophageal dilation in the mid-cervical region, with marked luminal narrowing distally. Computed tomography with angiography revealed esophageal stenosis, extending from C4-T2, secondary to circumferential esophageal wall thickening. With the concern for development of secondary aspiration pneumonia, the owners elected to euthanize the dog and consented to postmortem examination. A diagnosis of segmental, cervical esophageal muscular hypertrophy was made on necropsy, consistent with the fibromuscular thickening type of congenital esophageal stenosis reported in humans.
