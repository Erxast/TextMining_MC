Title : Muscle imaging in clinical practice: diagnostic value of muscle magnetic resonance imaging in inherited neuromuscular disorders.
Date : 2005
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This review reports on the use of muscle magnetic resonance imaging as a clinical and research tool in inherited neuromuscular disorders.Several papers published during the past few years have reported on the value of muscle magnetic resonance imaging in detecting patterns of muscle involvement in various muscular dystrophies and other inherited myopathies. The patterns of muscle involvement observed on muscle magnetic resonance imaging are often specific for distinct genetic entities.Our review of the literature suggests that muscle magnetic resonance imaging can provide information that is useful in clinical practice and may be used as an additional tool in a diagnostic flow chart to select appropriate genetic and biochemical investigations.
