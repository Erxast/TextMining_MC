Abstract : Adefovir dipivoxil is commonly used for treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The renal toxicity of adefovir dipivoxil is dose- and time-related, occurring often in patients with a daily dose over 30 mg and those with impaired renal function. We report a case of chronic hepatitis B with a history of taking adefovir dipivoxil at 10 mg/day for 4 years. The patient complained of lumbosacral and joint pain and had the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or spondyloarthropathy in several hospitals before admission in our hospital. A diagnosis of acquired Fanconi syndrome and hypophosphatemia osteomalacia associated with progressive muscular weakness was made eventually. We reviewed the literature and found reports of only fewer than 10 similar cases. Clinical attention should be given to kidney damage induced by adefovir dipivoxil.
