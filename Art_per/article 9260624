Title : The dorsal transposition flap for congenital contractures of the first web space: a 20-year experience.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Fifty-four dorsal transposition flaps were performed in 38 patients (46 hands) for severe congenital thumb web-space contractures. At an average follow-up interval of 6 years, complications or unsatisfactory results had occurred in 100% of symbrachydactyly patients and in 27% of all other patients. Postoperative first web-space angle was augmented an average of 59 degrees with a distal flap two-point discrimination of 8 mm. Mean postoperative pinch and grip strengths were 58% and 72%, respectively, of the normal contralateral hand. Parental satisfaction with the functional results was high, and the aesthetic results were generally acceptable. With the exception of symbrachydactyly patients, the dorsal transposition flap remains an excellent reconstructive option for severe congenital contractures of the thumb web space.
