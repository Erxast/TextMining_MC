Abstract : Van Den Ende-Gupta Syndrome (VDEGS) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive syndrome with less than 20 reported families (approximately 40 patients) in the worldwide literature.We have assessed one consanguineous Saudi family with typical features of VDEGS. Two siblings were affected with almost identical features; including blepharophimosis, arachnodactyly, flexion contractures of the elbows, camptodactyly, slender ribs, hooked lateral clavicular ends, and bilateral radial head dislocations. Both patients had several unusual features; including joint laxity, flat feet, recurrent patellar dislocations, and bilateral short distal ulnae. Full sequencing of SCARF2 revealed a homozygous mutation c.773G > A (p. Cys258Tyr) in both affected children. The parents (both with no abnormalities) were heterozygous for the same mutation.Joint laxity, recurrent patellar dislocations, and short distal ulnae should be included as part of the clinical spectrum of VDEGS.
