Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : By reviewing the literature concerning primary myopathies in man and animals, a classification of spontaneous primary myopathies in domestic mammals is made. This classification is based on aetiological factors. Primary myopathies are divided into metabolic, immunologic, toxic, nutritional, congenital, inherited, and inflammatory myopathies. Muscular dystrophies, in accordance with the definition in human cases, are considered as a separate entity. In the description of the different muscle disorders the emphasis is on the structural changes and the pathogenesis. Clinical signs and diagnostic criteria are considered only briefly.
