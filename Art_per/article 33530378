Abstract : Osteogenesis imperfecta is a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue diseases characterized by increased bone fragility, low growth, sometimes accompanied by abnormalities within the dentine, blue sclera, and partial or total hearing impairment. The changes may affect all joints, including the cervical spine and temporomandibular joints in the future, resulting in pain. The aim of the present study was to assess whether there is a relationship between the active range of motion of the cervical spine and the mobility of temporomandibular joints due to differential diagnosis in children with osteogenesis imperfecta, and to present a prevention algorithm for temporomandibular disorders. The study involved a group of 34 children with osteogenesis imperfecta, and the control group included 23 children (age 9.1 Â± 3.8 years). Data were collected through an interview based on the author's questionnaire, and the physical examination consisted in measuring the mobility of the cervical spine using an inclinometer (Cervical Range of Motion Instrument), the Helkimo scale, and linear measurements. In children with congenital bone fragility, there were acoustic symptoms from the temporomandibular joints more often than in healthy children. A correlation was found between the mobility of the cervical spine and temporomandibular joints in the study group. In the case of detecting irregularities in the temporomandibular joints, children were ordered to perform jaw-tongue coordination exercises.
