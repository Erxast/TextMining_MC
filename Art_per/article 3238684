Abstract : A three year old girl with a severe type of camptodactyly of 100 degrees in the right little finger was successfully treated conservatively. A well tolerated circular below elbow plaster of Paris with the PIP joint in maximal extension was applied and changed at short intervals. Gradually after eight weeks complete extension and full return of function as well as a marked radiographic remodelling of the PIP joint were obtained. A slight relapse to 25 degrees of contracture at 2 years follow-up was soon corrected the same way.
