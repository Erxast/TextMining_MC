Abstract : Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS; OMIM%249210) is a rare and severe form of congenital intestinal and urinary dysfunction and malformation. Histologic studies suggest that the predominant intestinal manifestation is smooth muscle myopathy. Molecular observations have linked the disease to the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (ηAChR), namely the absence of a functional α3 subunit of the ηAChR in patients with MMIHS. We describe a case of MMIHS in association with a de novo deletion of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (15q11.2). Histologic evaluation revealed an appropriate light microscopic appearance of both the circular and longitudinal layers of the small bowel muscularis propria. Immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle actin, however, was selectively absent in the circular layer, demonstrating isolated absence in a unique and previously undescribed pattern. These observations raise the possibility that the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (15q11) may be of clinical significance in MMIHS.
