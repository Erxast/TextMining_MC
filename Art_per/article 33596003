Abstract : Collagen VI-related myopathies are caused by mutations of COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 and present with a wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from severe Ulrich congenital muscular dystrophy to mild Bethlem myopathy. Here, we report a consanguineous Kurdish family with 3 siblings affected by autosomal-recessive Bethlem myopathy caused by compound heterozygous mutations of COL6A3. We found the previously described missense mutation c.7447A > G/p.(Lys2483Glu) and a novel large deletion encompassing the exon 1-39 of the COL6A3 gene. Apart from the classical clinical symptoms, all patients had keratoconus, which expands the phenotype of the collagen VI-related myopathies.
