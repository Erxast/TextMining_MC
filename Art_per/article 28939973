Title : Sodium Channelopathies of Skeletal Muscle.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 sodium channel is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it carries almost all of the inward Na<sup>+</sup> current that generates the action potential, but is not present at significant levels in other tissues. Consequently, mutations of SCN4A encoding Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 produce pure skeletal muscle phenotypes that now include six allelic disorders: sodium channel myotonia, paramyotonia congenita, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, congenital myasthenia, and congenital myopathy with hypotonia. Mutation-specific alternations of Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 function explain the mechanistic basis for the diverse phenotypes and identify opportunities for strategic intervention to modify the burden of disease.
