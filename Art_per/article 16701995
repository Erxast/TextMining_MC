Title : POMT2 mutation in a patient with 'MEB-like' phenotype.
Date : 2006
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Mutations in POMT2 have so far only been reported in patients with Walker-Warburg phenotype. We report heterozygous POMT2 mutations in an a girl with a milder phenotype characterized by mental retardation, microcephaly, hypertrophy of the quadriceps and calf muscles, and structural brain changes mostly affecting the posterior fossa. Our findings suggest that, as previously reported for POMT1 and FKRP, mutations in the POMT2 can also be associated with clinical heterogeneity.
