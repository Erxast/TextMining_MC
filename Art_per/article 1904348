Abstract : Case records of horses with muscle disorders presenting to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital of the University of California, Davis, over a nine year period were evaluated.

Other causes of myogenic muscle disorders included congenital, infectious, immune-mediated and nutritional factors.
