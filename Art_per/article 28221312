Abstract : In this edition of this column, we review new studies concerning the pathophysiology, treatment, and outcomes of patients with necrotizing myopathy, genetic testing in congenital myopathies, and limb girdle muscular dystrophies, and the incidence of polyneuropathy in the myotonic dystrophies. Various studies in myasthenia gravis, including those concerning antibody testing, clinical features, and quality of life are also reviewed as are recent findings in congenital myasthenic syndromes. Finally, 2 studies concerning polyneuropathy are discussed, including one on the association of polyneuropathy in patients with the metabolic syndrome and one on laboratory testing in patients with otherwise idiopathic small fiber polyneuropathy.
