Title : Some effects of congenital spasticity on fundamental frequency.
Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : 5 normal speakers and 5 speakers with congenital upper motor-neuron damage repeatedly spoke a three-work sentence stressing the first, second, or third words. Fundamental frequency was measured for each word and over each sentence. Analysis showed that the spastics' mean fundamental frequency was significantly higher than the normals', regardless of utterance. Also, spastics were more restricted in their prosodic maneuvering above this average fundamental frequency. Despite this finding, the spastics were capable of producing consistent stress patterns with normal variability.
