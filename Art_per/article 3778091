Title : [Rod myopathy. A fatal neonatal case].
Date : 1986
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A new lethal case of nemaline myopathy is reported. Muscle biopsy at 20 days of age permitted the diagnosis but this boy died at the 35th day of life. In a review of the literature (15 similar cases) the authors analyse the diagnostic, histopathogenic, genetic and evolutive aspects of this heterogeneous disorder, apparently less "benign" than previously thought.
