Abstract : We report on the expression of growth associated protein (GAP)43 and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in congenital fibre type disproportion (CFTD) with myopathological additional signs of interstitial myositis. We assume that sarcolemmal GAP43 in developmental disordered myocytes plays a role in maintenance of growth morphology. In muscular dystrophy light microscopical evaluation reveals no GAP43 immunoreactivity in regenerating fibres. The expression of GAP43 seems to be a characteristic feature of CFTD. The expression of NCAM, particularly in the sarcolemma of small muscle fibres of CFTD, indicates a functional state of permanent partial denervation. Whether the steroid-responsive interstitial myositis is pathogenetically related to CFTD or a coincidental inflammation is not known. Because of the clinical and myopathological data the differential diagnosis of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is considered.
