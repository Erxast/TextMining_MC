Abstract : Pathogenic variants in MYH7 cause a wide range of cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases with childhood or adult onset. These include dilated and/or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, congenital myopathies with multi-minicores and myofiber type disproportion, myosin storage myopathy, Laing distal myopathy and others (scapulo-peroneal or limb-girdle muscle forms). Here we report the results from molecular genetic analyses (NGS and Sanger sequencing) of 4 patients in two families with variable neuromuscular phenotypes with or without cardiac involvement. Interestingly, variants in MYH7 gene appeared to be the cause in all the cases. A novel nonsense variant c.5746C>T, p.(Gln1916Ter) was found in the patient in Family 1 who deceased at the age of 2 years 4 months with the clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, whose father died before the age of 40 years, due to cardiac failure with clinical diagnosis of suspected limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. A splice acceptor variant c.5560-2A>C in MYH7 was detected in the second proband and her sister, with late onset distal myopathy without cardiac involvement. These different phenotypes (muscular involvement with severe cardiomyopathy and pure late onset neuromuscular phenotype without heart involvement) may result from novel MYH7 variants, which most probably impact the LMM (light meromyosin) domain's function of the mature protein.
