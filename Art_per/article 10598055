Abstract : The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between epilepsy and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with spastic cerebral palsy at five years of age. We studied 14 patients with congenital anomaly and 116 with perinatal injury. The patients with perinatal injury were subdivided into two groups; those with preterm type injury alone (group P), and those with term type injury with or without preterm type injury (group T). Epilepsy was found in 37 of the 130 patients. The initial type of seizures was partial in 12 patients. infantile spasms in 20 and generalized in five. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with congenital anomaly had a higher incidence and an earlier onset of epilepsy than those with perinatal injury. Of the patients with perinatal injury, group T patients showed a higher incidence and a later onset of epilepsy than group P patients.
