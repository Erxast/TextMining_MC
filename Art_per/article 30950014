Abstract : To explore the clinical features and variations of ACADVL gene in 9 neonates with very long chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD).VLCADD was suspected based on the results of neonatal screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS), with tetradecenoylcarnitine ± tetradecenoylcarnitine/octanoylcarnitine (C14: 1 ± C14: 1/C8) as the mark indexes. Infants with positive outcome were confirmed by sequencing of the ACADVL gene.Among 9 VLCADD cases, one case lost during follow-up, the observed phenotypes comprised 2 with severe early-onset form, 1 with hepatic form and 5 with late-onset form. Optimal outcome was acquired for all patients except the 2 early-onset cases. In total 16 ACADVL variations were detected among the 9 infants, which included 8 novel variations (c.96-105del GCCCGGCCCT, c.541C>T, c.863T>G, c.878+1G>C, c.895A>G, c.1238T>C, c.1276G>A, and c.1505T>A) and 11 missense variations. There were 9 genotypic combinations, including 1 homozygote and 8 compound heterozygotes. Except for two patients carrying null variations, all had a good outcome.VLCADD is relatively rare in southern China, for which late-onset form is common. Carriers of null variations of the ACADVL gene may have relatively poorer clinical outcome. Above results will provide valuable information for the diagnosis and management of VLCADD.
