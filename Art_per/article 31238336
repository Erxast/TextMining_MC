Abstract : Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of progressive genetic diseases affecting the musculature that are characterized by inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis and connective tissue and fat replacement of the affected muscles. Unfortunately, treatments do not exist for the vast majority of MD patients. Adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)-based gene therapy is thus emerging as a potential treatment for many types of MD. Treatments strategies based on AAV are being adapted for replacement of mutant disease-causing genes, knockdown of dominant disease-causing genes using antisense oligonucleotides or inhibitory RNAs, delivery of gene editing tools such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 and effecting alterations in pre-mRNA splicing and by manipulating expression levels of modifier genes. Translational and clinical trial work focused on these types of AAV treatments for Duchenne MD, various limb girdle MDs, myotonic dystrophy 1, facioscapulohumeral MD, dysferlinopathies and congenital MDs are discussed here, with a focus on recent studies, pre-clinical large animal work and many promising ongoing and upcoming AAV clinical trials.
