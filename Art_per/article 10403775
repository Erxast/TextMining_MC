Abstract : We have determined the structure and the exon size pattern of the human integrin alpha7 subunit gene (ITGA7), which has been shown to be affected in a form of congenital myopathy. The gene is composed of at least 27 exons spanning a region of about 22.5 kb. The sequence of all exon/intron boundaries was determined and conforms to the GT/AG splicing consensus. We investigated the different splicing forms previously described in human and rodents. The major cytoplasmic variants alpha7A and alpha7B, which are developmentally regulated and tissue specific, were identified in human tissues, as well as the extracellular isoforms X1 and X2. The recently described D variant was detected in adult tissues by RT-PCR but not the C variant. We localized ITGA7 on chromosome 12q13 by high-resolution radiation hybrid mapping between D12S312 and D12S90 and identified a new CA-repeat microsatellite in intron 1.
