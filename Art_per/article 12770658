Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare congenital disorder of connective tissue, which has significant implications on anesthetic management of affected patients, e.g., application of difficult airway algorithm, avoiding any trauma during venous cannulation. FOP has received very limited reviews in the published anesthesia literature. We describe perioperative care of a 21-year-old female with established diagnosis of FOP presenting for hysteroscopy followed by dilatation and curettage. Multiorgan abnormalities of FOP are reviewed and available anesthetic options are analyzed and compared.
