Abstract : The skeletal muscle in 3 preterm infants (27, 34, 37 weeks gestation age) born to mothers with myotonic dystrophy showed a syncytial pattern at 27 weeks and a decreasing percentage of satellite cells and central nuclei at 34 and 37 weeks gestation. The fiber type differentiation was observed only at 37 weeks of gestational age. In all 3 cases muscle fibers with multiple acid phosphatase positive were seen. The muscle spindles also had thick capsules and showed lack of morphologic and histochemical differentiation into fiber types. These findings suggest immaturity of skeletal muscle in comparison to the normal. The immaturity of the skeletal muscle correlated well with the prognosis of the patients.
