Abstract : Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenital (AMC) is a group of muscular, neurologic and connective tissue disorders, characterized by multiple severe joint contractures and decreased mobility. The incidence of this condition is 1/3000 births while the etiology is variable. Prenatal assessment of arthrogryposis has focused primarily on diminished fetal movement and the presence of joint contractures or skeletal deformities. These findings may not become evident until after 16-18 weeks' gestational age, subsequently, early prenatal diagnosis is difficult. Nowadays, modern ultrasound techniques and special sonographic markers help the clinicians with the prenatal detection of arthrogryposis in every gestational trimester.
