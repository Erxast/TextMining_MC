Abstract : Biopsy specimens from the feet and proximal thigh musculature of two patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy with talipes equinovarus were compared. The findings were also compared with those reported in muscle biopsy of idiopathic clubfoot. It was concluded that structural change in intrinsic foot muscle can contribute to the force imbalance that produces clubfoot in this disease.
