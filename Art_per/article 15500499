Title : Liver biopsy complicated by hemorrhage in a patient with ARC syndrome.
Date : 2004
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : ARC syndrome is a rare disorder consisting of arthrogryposis, renal tubular acidosis and cholestatic liver disease. We report the case of a 5-week-old patient who underwent a percutaneous liver biopsy complicated by hemorrhage, and was subsequently diagnosed with ARC syndrome. A review of the literature demonstrates that these patients are at increased risk of bleeding caused by platelet dysfunction. The evaluation and management of unexpected hemorrhage in pediatric patients as a result of undiagnosed congenital bleeding problems is discussed.
