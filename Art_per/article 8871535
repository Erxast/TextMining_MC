Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Aino virus (AIV; JaNAr 28 strain) 10(3) TCID50/0.2 ml was inoculated in the yolk sac of 8-day-old chick embryos. Recovery and titration of the virus from various organs including the central nervous system (CNS) and skeletal muscle were performed at 2, 4, 7, 10 and 13 days after inoculation (PI). AIV was systematically disseminated and proliferated even 2 days PI. The titers of the recovered virus from the CNS and from skeletal muscle was the highest at 4 days PI and declined with time, whereas hydranencephaly, arthrogryposis and cerebellar hypoplasia developed at 7 days PI and gradually progressed until 13 days PI.
