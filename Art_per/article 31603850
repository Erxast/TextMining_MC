Abstract : Important advances have been made in the field of congenital myopathies in recent years, forcing clinicians to constantly review and update this group of diseases. The increasing identification of new genes and phenotypes associated with already known genes has been possible to a great extent thanks to the development accomplished in next generation sequencing techniques, which are increasingly accessible. Knowing better the phenotypic spectrum of these entities allows to establish a phenotype/genotype correlation in some subgroups. The best understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of these diseases are fundamental to design new therapies. The first clinical trials in the field of gene therapy are already a reality and are showing positive results, creating a new expectation for patients, families and specialists, which will be reflected in the need to adapt the protocols of care, diagnosis and treatment of some of these entities. It is essential that pediatric neurologists, pediatricians, physiotherapists and other professionals involved in the care of these patients are informed and updated on the advances in this group of diseases.
