Abstract : Congenital muscular dystrophy with laminin Î±2 chain-deficiency (LAMA2-CMD) is a severe muscle disorder with complex underlying pathogenesis. We have previously employed profiling techniques to elucidate molecular patterns and demonstrated significant metabolic impairment in skeletal muscle from LAMA2-CMD patients and mouse models. Thus, we hypothesize that skeletal muscle metabolism may be a promising pharmacological target to improve muscle function in LAMA2-CMD. Here, we have investigated whether the multifunctional medication metformin could be used to reduce disease in the dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mouse model of LAMA2-CMD. First, we show gender disparity for several pathological hallmarks of LAMA2-CMD. Second, we demonstrate that metformin treatment significantly increases weight gain and energy efficiency, enhances muscle function and improves skeletal muscle histology in female dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mice (and to a lesser extent in dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> males). Thus, our current data suggest that metformin may be a potential future supportive treatment that improves many of the pathological characteristics of LAMA2-CMD.
