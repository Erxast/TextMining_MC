Abstract : Mutations in DES, encoding desmin protein, are associated with different kinds of skeletal and/or cardiac myopathies. However, it is unknown, whether DES mutations are associated with left ventricular hypertrabeculation (LVHT). Here, we performed a clinical examination and subsequent genetic analysis in a family, with two individuals presenting LVHT with conduction disease and skeletal myopathy. The genetic analysis revealed a novel small in-frame deletion within the DES gene, p.Q113_L115del, affecting the Î±-helical rod domain. Immunohistochemistry analysis of explanted myocardial tissue from the index patient revealed an abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of desmin and a degraded sarcomeric structure. Cell transfection experiments with wild-type and mutant desmin verified the cytoplasmic aggregation and accumulation of mutant desmin. Cotransfection experiments were performed to model the heterozygous state of the patients and revealed a dominant negative effect of the mutant desmin on filament assembly. DES:p.Q113_L115del is classified as a pathogenic mutation associated with dilated cardiomyopathy with prominent LVHT.
