Abstract : Uterine anomalies causing fetal complications are very rarely encountered in obstetric practice and thus pose a diagnostic dilemma.A multigravid patient attended the clinic for an ultrasound examination in the third trimester following a recent hospital admission for abdominal pain. Ultrasound imaging revealed a large uterine diverticulum in the right cornu of the uterus with evidence of fetal leg entrapment. Because of concerns of increased soft tissue edema in the entrapped leg, the patient was delivered at 35 weeks' gestation by elective CS. The CS was complicated by uterine rupture at the diverticular portion. The neonatal course was complicated by compartment syndrome of the leg, and the infant underwent surgery on post-delivery day one with good outcome.Uterine diverticula are rare anomalies, and once they are diagnosed, the possibility of entrapment of fetal parts or placenta in pregnancy should be considered.
