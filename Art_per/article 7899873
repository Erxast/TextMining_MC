Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare hereditary connective tissue disorder. Patients with FOP develop progressive ossification of muscle and connective tissue associated with pain and disability. Onset is typically in childhood, and congenital anomalies of the feet are an early sign of this condition. Pain and stiffness of the spine or an inflammatory mass are common presenting features of FOP. Involvement of the spine often leads to complete fusion mimicking ankylosing spondylitis. Studies of twins and families suggest that FOP is a genetically inherited autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance but variable expressivity. While radionuclide imaging and computed tomography are very sensitive for new bone formation and greatly assist the diagnosis of FOP, unfortunately, effective therapy is unavailable. We present twins with FOP and review the clinical, radiographic, and genetic manifestations of this disorder.
