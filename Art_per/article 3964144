Abstract : Multiple congenital malformations occurred in 21 of 26 pigs (81%) in 3 litters from 2 piggeries. Two of 26 pigs (7%) were mummified while 3 of 26 (11%) were normal. Cheiloschisis was seen in all malformed pigs and was accompanied by various combinations of palatoschisis, arhinencephaly, hypoplasia of the spinal cord, arthrogryposis of the pelvic limbs, polydactyly, renal lesions and cauliflower ears. Histological examination suggested that arthrogryposis was due to neurogenic muscular atrophy. The teratogen was not identified.
