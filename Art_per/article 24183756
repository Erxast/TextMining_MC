Title : A fourth case of POMT2-related limb girdle muscle dystrophy with mild reduction of α-dystroglycan glycosylation.
Date : 2014
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : POMT2 mutations have been identified in Walker-Warburg syndrome or muscle-eye-brain-like, but rarely in limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD).Two POMT2 mutations, one null and one missense, were found in a patient with LGMD and mild mental impairment, no brain or ocular involvement, minor histopathological features, and slight reduction of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) glycosylation and α-DG laminin binding.Our case, the fourth LGMD POMT2-mutated reported to date, provides further evidence of correlation between level of α-DG glycosylation and phenotype severity.
