Title : Congenital ichthyosis with spastic paraplegia of adult onset.
Date : 1975
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two siblings had what we believe to be a unique disorder manifested by stationary congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma coupled with a slowly progressive spastic weakness of adult onset. The disorder was presumably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The mechanism by which a genetic mutation would mediate this multiple organ system disorder is unknown.
