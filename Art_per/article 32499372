Abstract : Mutations in the ryanodine receptor 1 (<i>RYR1</i>) gene are associated with several human congenital myopathies, including the dominantly inherited central core disease and exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis, and the more severe recessive phenotypes, including multiminicore disease, centronuclear myopathy, and congenital fiber type disproportion. Within the latter group, those carrying a hypomorphic mutation in one allele and a missense mutation in the other are the most severely affected. Because of nonsense-mediated decay, most hypomorphic alleles are not expressed, resulting in homozygous expression of the missense mutation allele. This should result in 50% reduced expression of the ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle, but its observed content is even lower. To study in more detail the biochemistry and pathophysiology of recessive <i>RYR1</i> myopathies, here we investigated a mouse model we recently generated by analyzing the effect of bi-allelic <i>versus</i> mono-allelic expression of the RyR1 p.A4329D mutation. Our results revealed that the expression of two alleles carrying the same mutation or of one allele with the mutation in combination with a hypomorphic allele does not result in functionally equal outcomes and impacts skeletal muscles differently. In particular, the bi-allelic RyR1 p.A4329D mutation caused a milder phenotype than its mono-allelic expression, leading to changes in the biochemical properties and physiological function only of slow-twitch muscles and largely sparing fast-twitch muscles. In summary, bi-allelic expression of the RyR1 p.A4329D mutation phenotypically differs from mono-allelic expression of this mutation in a compound heterozygous carrier.
