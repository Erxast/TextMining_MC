Title : Congenital myotonic myopathy in the miniature schnauzer: an autosomal recessive trait.
Date : 1999 Sep-Oct
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Myotonia is a clinical sign characterized by a delay in skeletal muscle relaxation following electrical or mechanical stimulation. A series of related miniature schnauzer dogs with congenital myotonic myopathy were studied. A composite pedigree of six affected litters and the results of a planned breeding between two affected animals are consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.
