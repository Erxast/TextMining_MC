Abstract : X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) is typically associated with DAX-1 mutations and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, atypical cases of X-linked AHC in association with central precocious puberty and even normal puberty have rarely been reported, although the mechanism of action remains unknown.This is a case report of a boy with X-linked AHC associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, whose clinical presentation led to analysis of the DAX-1, glycerol kinase (GK1) and dystrophin genes, which were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, with Southern blot analysis of the AHC locus.There was a non-contiguous deletion of the DAX-1 and GK1 genes, with deletion of the dystrophingene from exons 3 to 79.This is the first report of X-linked AHC, central precocious puberty in the absence of the DAX-1 gene. The fact that a 'loss of function' DAX-1 mutation can be associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, precocious and normal puberty, suggests that DAX-1 is but one of several transcription factors which regulate puberty, and provides further evidence that other transcription factors may interact with DAX-1 and influence gonadal regulation in a complex, but hierarchical fashion.
