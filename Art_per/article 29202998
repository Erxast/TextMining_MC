Abstract : The talus secundarius is one of the rarest accessory tarsal bones, being present in 0.01% of all ankles. It is located at the lateral side of the talus, distally to the tip of the fibula. Hitherto, only five cases of a symptomatic talus secundarius have been described in literature. We presented a case of bilateral symptomatic talus secundarius in a young gymnast. There was a difference in size of the two accessory bones. The large talus secundarius in the left ankle was fixated, in the right ankle the fragment was excised. Both excision and fixation in the presented patient led to satisfactory results, both in the short and long term outcome.
