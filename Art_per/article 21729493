Abstract : We present two procedures of transcatheter closure: that of an aorto-pulmonary window in a 12-month-old infant with a body weight of 7 kilograms, and that of ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm into the right atrium in an adult patient. In the first case, we applied the muscular ventricular septal defect Cardio-O-Fix, while in the other we applied the patent ductus arteriosus Cardio-O-Fix occluder. The procedures were successful in both patients, and we achieved complete closure of the unwanted shunts.
