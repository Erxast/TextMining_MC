Date : 2011
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The group of patients with weakness or fatigue who have electrophysiological evidence of neuromuscular transmission defects, but no antibodies against either acetyl choline receptor or muscle specific kinase, need special evaluation and therapeutic consideration. Such seronegative patients may have low affinity antibodies but may also be late onset of a congenital myasthenic syndrome. This review discuss the practical approach toward the condition of seronegative myasthenia.
