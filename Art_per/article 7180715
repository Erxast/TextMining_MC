Title : Operative experience with malfunction of the eyelid.
Date : 1982
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : During the past 10 years, the authors have observed several cases of malfunction of the eyelids, such as congenital lid retraction, lagophthalmos accompanying facial nerve palsy, ocular myopathy, blepharochalasis, traumatic lid ptosis, and Horner's syndrome. Several operational techniques were utilized in these cases. Some operative cases are presented together with pre- and postoperative photographs. To obtain aesthetically pleasing results, the authors felt the most exacting techniques were necessary for even minor deformities.
