Abstract : In a retrospective study of 29 dogs with congenital pulmonic stenosis, we evaluated the clinical, radiographic, angiocardiographic, and cardiac catheterization data. Eighteen dogs had no clinical signs of disease and were referred for evaluation of a previously detected cardiac murmur, 5 dogs had congestive right-sided heart failure, and 5 dogs were examined for exercise intolerance or syncope. Dogs with heart failure tended to be older than dogs without clinical signs of heart failure (19.3 months vs 12 months). All dogs had radiographic or electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular enlargement. Poststenotic dilatation of the main pulmonary artery and apparent pulmonary undercirculation were observed frequently on survey radiographs. Isolated pulmonic valve dysplasia, representing a range of angiographic pulmonic valve abnormalities, was evident in 88% of the available 26 angiographic studies, whereas subvalvular stenosis was uncommon and observed in only 2 dogs. Muscular hypertrophy of the right ventricular infundibulum and supraventricular crest were observed in 96% and 25% of the angiocardiograms, respectively. Poststenotic dilatation of the main pulmonary artery was observed in every dog. A ratio between the width of the main pulmonary artery and the valve annulus was useful in identifying pulmonic stenosis and distinguishing this anomaly from other congenital malformations. The degree of poststenotic dilatation did not appear to be related to the severity of the systolic pressure gradient, which ranged from 20 to 228 mm of Hg (mean, 93 mm of Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
