Abstract : Fibrillin-2 (FBN2) is an important component of microfibers which are involved in the formation of elastic fibers in connective tissue throughout the human body. Hereditary connective tissue diseases may result from genetic mutations of FBN2 causing heterogeneity of fibrin. Genetic mutations of FBN2 are associated with a variety of hereditary connective tissue diseases including Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyl (CCA), Macular Degeneration (MD), and myopathy. Studies have shown that the FBN2 gene is recognized as the only pathogenic gene related to CCA and that CCA patients have different clinical presentations depending on the identified genetic mutations at different FBN2 sites. In this review, we summarize the roles of FBN2, its mutations and impact on the physiological and pathological processes of many hereditary connective tissue diseases. We include brief descriptions of clinical manifestations of these diseases providing a basis for further exploration of the specific molecular mechanism of FBN2 gene mutation pathogenesis which provides a theoretical basis for the therapy and medications for refractory diseases caused by FBN2 gene mutation.
