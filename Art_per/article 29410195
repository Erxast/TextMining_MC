Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Morning glory disk anomaly is a nonhereditary, congenital optic disk dysplasia characterized by conical excavation of the posterior fundus with a central glial tuft and radial retinal vessels. We report the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with esotropia, enophthalmos, no light perception, and afferent pupillary defect in her left eye; fundus examination revealed morning glory disk anomaly. Ultrasound B-scan showed axial length increasing in the left eye on consensual light exposure. Magnetic resonance imaging/angiogram of the brain and orbits were within normal limits except for globe elongation posteriorly in the left eye. On examination under anesthesia with video indirect ophthalmoscopy, the left optic disk showed contraction and expansion when stimulated by strong light to the fellow eye and no spontaneous contraction on direct light stimulation. Morning glory disk contractility with increasing axial length on consensual light exposure in a child has not been reported previously.
