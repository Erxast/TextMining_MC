Abstract : Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 is essential for skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Its functional expression is tuned by numerous regulatory proteins, yet underlying modulatory mechanisms remain ambiguous as Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 fails to function in heterologous systems. In this study, by dissecting channel trafficking versus gating, we evaluated the requirements for functional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 in heterologous systems. Although coexpression of the auxiliary Î² subunit is sufficient for surface-membrane localization, this baseline trafficking is weak, and channels elicit a diminished open probability. The regulatory proteins calmodulin and stac3 independently enhance channel trafficking and gating via their interaction with the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 carboxy terminus. Myopathic stac3 mutations weaken channel binding and diminish trafficking. Our findings demonstrate that multiple regulatory proteins orchestrate Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 function via duplex mechanisms. Our work also furnishes insights into the pathophysiology of stac3-associated congenital myopathy and reveals novel avenues for pharmacological intervention.
