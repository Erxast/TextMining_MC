Title : Novel FGD1 mutation underlying Aarskog-Scott syndrome with myopathy and distal arthropathy.
Date : 2013
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In this report, we describe a kindred consisting of five affected males presenting with many of the well-recognized features of Aarskog-Scott syndrome. The diagnosis, which was confirmed by the identification of a novel nonsense mutation of FGD1, was associated with the presence of a symmetric distal arthropathy with electromyographic signs of myopathy. These features should be considered in the evaluation of future patients.
