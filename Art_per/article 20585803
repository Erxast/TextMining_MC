Abstract : Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder characterized by severe gastrointestinal dysmotility and leads to cachexia, ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, peripheral neuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy.It is often misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa or intestinal pseudoobstuctions and are unnecessarily treated with surgery. It has been established that MNGIE is caused by mutations in the gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase, which lead to absolute or nearly complete loss of its catalytic activity, producing systemic accumulations of its substrates, thymidine and deoxyuridine.We present herein the clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular findings of a patient with MNGIE caused by a novel homozygous TYMP gene mutation (c.112G>T which convert codon 38 from glutamate to a stop codon [p.38E>X]).
