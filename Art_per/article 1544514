Date : 1992
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The adductor longus tendon was tagged with metallic markers after posterior adductor transfer in 17 children (33 hips) with cerebral palsy: 10 had spastic diplegia and seven had spastic quadriplegia. The average age at operation was 5 years 3 months, time of postoperative immobilization 5.7 weeks and average follow-up 1 year 7 months. In 19 hips the tendon remained attached to the ischium, in 11 hips it pulled away from the ischium and in three hips the result was equivocal. The incidence of detachment was higher among diplegic children than quadriplegic children.
