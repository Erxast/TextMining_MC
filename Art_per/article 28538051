Abstract : Mobius syndrome is a rare syndrome that is known to be associated with a variety of orthopaedic conditions including scoliosis, clubfoot, transverse limb deficiencies, Poland syndrome, and a myriad of hand conditions. To date, no large series exist to characterize the orthopaedic manifestations of Mobius syndrome.Medical records at a single tertiary pediatric institution were reviewed for all patients diagnosed with Mobius syndrome from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2015. Records and radiographs were reviewed for associated orthopaedic conditions and their management.In total, 44 patients with Mobius syndrome were identified. Age at presentation ranged from 6 days to 14 years. When compared with the general population, patients with Mobius syndrome had an increased incidence of clubfoot (41%), Poland syndrome (20%), and scoliosis (14%). Clubfoot treated both before and after the institution of Ponseti casting had a high rate of requiring posteromedial release, with a significant rate of subsequent revision. Hip dysplasia was noted in 1 patient and required surgical correction. Other associated syndromes included arthrogryposis, Pierre Robin syndrome, and chromosome 10 defect.Mobius syndrome is accompanied by an increased rate of several orthopaedic problems; most notably clubfoot, scoliosis, and upper extremity differences that often require surgical treatment. The management of clubfoot in the setting of Mobius syndrome often requires surgical intervention due to failure of casting, and seems to have a higher rate of need for revision. Early involvement of orthopaedists in the care of patients with Mobius syndrome is often necessary. Orthopaedist should counsel families that treatment may be more complex than that of idiopathic disease.Level IV-case series.
