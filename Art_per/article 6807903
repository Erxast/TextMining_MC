Abstract : To clarify the effects of operation for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis in early childhood on mandibular growth, cephalometric x-ray films of two congenital cases in children who were operated at 2 years old were obtained longitudinally for 9 years. Comparison with those operated at 12 years old, and normal children at the same age, gave the following results: (1) Mandibular retrognathia is slighter than in cases operated later; (2) The mandibles showed a rate of growth nearly the same as that of normal mandibles postoperatively; (3) Forward-downward craniofacial growth was recognized in the cases of early operation; and (4) In the unilateral case, the deviation of the median line of the mandible to the affected side became slighter postoperatively. At present, functional restoration is satisfactory in early-operated cases. In conclusion, it is suggested that restoration of function of the TM joint by early operation is more effective for mandibular growth.
