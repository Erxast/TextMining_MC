Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia (BDH) is a common birth defect that is associated with other congenital malformations. Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma (HMH) is the second most common benign hepatic tumor in children. The association between BDH and HMH or ectopic hepatic tissue is uncommon. We report a case of a female newborn with a left BDH that at surgery was incidentally found to have a tumor of 3.5 cm in maximum dimension with a serous muscular membrane. The histopathological study revealed vascular-mesenchymal stroma with bile ducts entrapped and peripheral normal hepatic tissue. These findings correlate with the diagnosis of hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma (HMH) in ectopic hepatic tissue. Our objective is to report a case of a rare association between HMH and BDH as well as discuss its differential diagnosis.
