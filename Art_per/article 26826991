Abstract : A different and rare type of atrophy with a predominant pattern in scapulo-peroneal distribution was described by Davidenkow in 1939. The syndrome was characterized by some researchers as a variant of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, however Davidenkow noticed that clinical and laboratorial manifestations did not corroborate exactly with this hypothesis. We describe a case of a female patient, 39 years-old, clinical picture similar to the syndrome described by Davidenkow, presenting scapulo-peroneal atrophy. Her first symptoms had appeared when she was 24, initially with proximal motor weakness in the upper limbs. This patient did not have family history of myopathy or neuropathy. Several tests were performed to exclude other syndromes that could be included in the differential diagnosis, by testing gene mutation, in addition to the physical examination and electromyography. The large spectrum of neuromuscular diseases makes difficult the diagnosis of Davidenkow's syndrome which always should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
