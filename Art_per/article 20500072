Date : 2010
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital bony fusion of the maxilla and mandible, especially as an isolated occurrence, is a very rare condition. The very few cases reported in the literature are mostly inadequate in description and confusing in nomenclature. An isolated case of syngnathia in a 60-year-old female patient with unilateral bony fusion (synostosis) of the maxilla and mandible associated with fibrous adhesions (synechiae) of the opposite site is reported. The existent literature is also reviewed.
