Abstract : Ryanodine receptor 1 (<i>RYR1</i>) is an intracellular calcium receptor primarily expressed in skeletal muscle with a role in excitation contraction. Both dominant and recessive mutations in the <i>RYR1</i> gene cause a range of <i>RYR1</i>-related myopathies and/or susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH). Recently, an atypical manifestation of ptosis, variably presenting with ophthalmoplegia, facial paralysis, and scoliosis but without significant muscle weakness, has been reported in 9 cases from 4 families with bialleic variants in <i>RYR1</i>. Two affected children from a consanguineous family with severe congenital ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, scoliosis, and distinctive long faces but without skeletal myopathy were studied. To identify the cause of the hereditary condition, DNA from the proband was subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). WES revealed a novel homozygous missense variant in <i>RYR1</i> (c.14066T>A; p.IIe4689Asn), which segregated within the family. Although the phenotype of the affected siblings in this study was similar to previously described cases, the clinical features were more severely expressed. Our findings contribute to the expansion of phenotypes related to <i>RYR1</i> dysfunction. Additionally, it supports a new <i>RYR1</i>-related clinical presentation without musculoskeletal involvement. It is important that individuals with <i>RYR1</i> mutations are considered susceptible to MH, as 70% of the MH cases are caused by mutations in the <i>RYR1</i> gene.
