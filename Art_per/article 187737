Abstract : Five cases of a congenital neurological disorder are reported. Four patients, born after a breech delivery, belong to one sibship while the fifth patient is the only child in another family. The clinical features include quadriplegia, amyotrophy, a peripheral neuropathy, severe mental retardation and a subluxation of the hips. X-rays reveal diffuse osteoporosis and multiple spontaneous fractures. Autopsies in 3 patients showed multiple system atrophies involving the spinal cord and the cerebellum, coarse cerebral gyri and a marked reduction in volume of the white matter. These various pathological features are compared with the lesions found in a few other cases reported in the literature, none of which can be considered to be identical to the ones described. It is therefore felt that the condition under discussion represents a new syndrome to be classified, at least temporarily, within the group of multiple system atrophies.
