Abstract : This is to introduce the experience in clinical applications of the island and myocutaneous flaps.Since 1985 fifteen types of vascularized island and myocutaneous flaps have been applied in 52 cases (21 positions) for the following purposes: repairing traumatic soft tissue defects on the limb, scar contracture, congenital recto-vaginal fistula, reconstructing congenital nasal deformity and rehabilitating function. The non-major artery island flap was used in 47 cases (90.38%) and the retrograde island flap was used in 24 cases (46.15%). The size of the flap ranged from 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm to 15 cm x 12 cm.All the flaps survived with primary healing. Follow-up for 8 months to 11 years showed aesthetically and functionally satisfactory results in all cases.These island and myocutaneous flaps have rich blood supply and are highly anti-infective. The operation is easy and the success rate is high.
