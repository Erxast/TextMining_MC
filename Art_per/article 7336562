Abstract : No congenital arthrogryposis or other deformities were found in newborn Hampshire pigs born to sows administered Datura stramonium (jimsonweed) during the second or third months of pregnancy at levels producing marked clinical signs of toxicity in the dams. The results suggest that jimsonweed is not teratogenic in pigs, contrary to epidemiologic speculation by other workers.
