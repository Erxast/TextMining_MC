Abstract : To assess the clinical and histopathological features of a case of congenital orbital cyst originating from the common sheath of the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superior muscles.Preoperative, peroperative and postoperative characteristics of the described clinical condition in a 37-year-old woman is documented.The cyst was found to be related with the common sheath of the superior rectus and levator muscles during the surgical intervention and histopathological examination revealed a cystic structure with a lining resembling that of conjunctiva.Our findings support the proposal by Rose & O'Donnell who first reported four cases in 1995 suggesting a new group of congenital orbital cysts distinct from dermoid, epidermoid or conjunctival cysts.
