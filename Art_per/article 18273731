Abstract : Myopathies are frequently not confined to the skeletal muscles but also involve other organs or tissues. One of the most frequently affected organ in addition to the skeletal muscle is the heart (cardiac involvement, CI). CI manifests as impulse generation or conduction defects, focal or diffuse myocardial thickening, dilation of the cardiac cavities, relaxation abnormality, hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive cardiomyopathy, apical form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, noncompaction, Takotsubo phenomenon, secondary valve insufficiency, intra-cardiac thrombus formation, or heart failure with systolic or diastolic dysfunction. CI occurs in dystrophinopathies, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophies, laminopathies, congenital muscular dystrophies, myotonic dystrophies, congenital myopathies, metabolic myopathies, desminopathies, myofibrillar myopathy, Barth syndrome, McLeod syndrome, Senger's syndrome, and Bethlem myopathy. Patients with myopathy should be cardiologically investigated as soon as their neurological diagnosis is established, since supportive cardiac therapy is available, which markedly influences prognosis and outcome of CI in these patients.
