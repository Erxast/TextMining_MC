Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In a muscle biopsy specimen from a baby girl with hypotonia, there was the ultrastructural finding of selective myosin degeneration in some myofibers. The sarcomeres were either well aligned or completely distorted. Excessive glycogen, fiber and fibril splitting, and occasional aggregates of vesicles were the other abnormalities present.
