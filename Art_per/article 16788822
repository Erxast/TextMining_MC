Abstract : We investigated whether beta-amyloid and tau protein are involved in the formation of inclusion body myositis (IBM)-like inclusions found in children with rimmed vacuoles and congenitally affected muscles. We immunostained muscle biopsy specimens from four children and one 18-year-old boy with congenital myopathy containing rimmed vacuoles and IBM-like inclusions with antibodies against beta-amyloid, tau protein and ubiquitin. Focal accumulations of both beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau coexisted with tubulofilamentous structures in all cases. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that the full morphological phenotype of IBM including beta-amyloid and tau protein deposits may also develop in children, and that congenital, probably genetic, muscle defects may lead to abnormal protein aggregation in IBM-like inclusions.
