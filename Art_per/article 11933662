Abstract : Arthrogryposis, is the occurrence of joint contractures of variable etiology that start prenatally. Arthrogryposis may result from neurologic deficit, neuromuscular disorders, connective tissue abnormalities, amniotic bands, [figure: see text] or fetal crowding. Arthrogryposis may result from no apparent hereditary causes (neuropathic, for example) or may be the result of hereditary factors (myopathic form, for example). Ultrasound diagnosis depends on observation of scant or absent motion of fetal extremities. Prognosis depends on the specific etiology of the contractures.
