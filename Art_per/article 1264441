Date : 1976
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The purpose of treatment of arthrogryposis of the lower extremities is to achieve a stable functional weight bearing position of the affected joints. One cannot expect to achieve normal mobility and gait unless the process is mild. Achieving a functional weight bearing position of a joint may be extremely difficult, requiring repeated surgical procedures. Maintenance of correction, although often imperfect, is vital during the growing period.
