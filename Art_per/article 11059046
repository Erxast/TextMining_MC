Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In 1828 John Nicolas Marjolini characterized ulcer with malignant degeneration which developed in scars after burns, but it occurs under varying clinical conditions. Typical feature is the latent period (on average 30 years). It is encountered in 2 forms: a shallow ulcer or exophytic tumour, most frequently on the lower extremities. At the Prague Burn Centre 11 patients were treated since 1978 till 1998. A unique case was a man suffering from congenital form of epidermolysis bullosa who developed Marjolin's ulcer on his foot (histological examination confirmed well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma). After 4 years he died with extreme cachexia and metastatic spread of the tumour, because he refused repeatedly amputation and lymph nodes dissection. To prevent Marjolin's ulcer several recommendations are presented.
