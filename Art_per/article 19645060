Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In this study we present 3 families with malignant hyperthermia (MH), all of Indian subcontinent descent. One individual from each of these families was fully sequenced for RYR1 and presented with the non-synonymous change c.11315G>A/p.R3772Q. When present in the homozygous state c.11315*A is associated with myopathic symptoms.
