Title : Autosomal recessive inheritance of RYR1 mutations in a congenital myopathy with cores.
Date : 2002
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Central core disease (CCD) is a congenital myopathy due to dominant mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1). The authors report three patients from two consanguineous families with symptoms of a congenital myopathy, cores on muscle biopsy, and confirmed linkage to the RYR1 locus. Molecular genetic studies in one family identified a V4849I homozygous missense mutation in the RYR1 gene. This report suggests a congenital myopathy associated with recessive RYR1 mutations.
