Abstract : Homozygous loss-of-function variants in MYO18B have been associated with congenital myopathy, facial dysmorphism and Klippel-Feil anomaly. So far, only four patients have been reported. Comprehensive description of new cases that help to highlight recurrent features and to further delineate the phenotypic spectrum are still missing. We present the fifth case of MYO18B-associated disease in a newborn male patient. Trio exome sequencing identified the previously unreported homozygous nonsense variant c.6433C>T, p.(Arg2145*) in MYO18B (NM_032608.5). While most phenotypic features of our patient align with previously reported cases, we describe the prenatal features for the first time. Taking the phenotypic description of our patient into account, we propose that the core phenotype comprises a severe congenital myopathy with feeding difficulties in infancy and characteristic dysmorphic features.
