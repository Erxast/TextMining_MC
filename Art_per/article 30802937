Abstract : Recessive mutations in multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 10 (MEGF10) underlie a rare congenital muscle disease known as MEGF10 myopathy. MEGF10 and its Drosophila homolog Draper (Drpr) are transmembrane receptors expressed in muscle and glia. Drpr deficiency is known to result in muscle abnormalities in flies. In the current study, flies that ubiquitously overexpress Drpr, or mouse Megf10, display developmental arrest. The phenotype is reproduced with overexpression in muscle, but not in other tissues, and with overexpression during intermediate stages of myogenesis, but not in myoblasts. We find that tubular muscle subtypes are particularly sensitive to Megf10/Drpr overexpression. Complementary genetic analyses show that Megf10/Drpr and Notch may interact to regulate myogenesis. Our findings provide a basis for investigating MEGF10 in muscle development using Drosophila.
