Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a progressive neuromuscular disease caused by expanded CUG repeats, which misregulate RNA metabolism through several RNA-binding proteins, including CUG-binding protein/CUGBP1 elav-like factor 1 (CUGBP1/CELF1) and muscleblind 1 protein. Mutant CUG repeats elevate CUGBP1 and alter CUGBP1 activity via a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)-cyclin D3-cyclin D-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) signaling pathway. Inhibition of GSK3β corrects abnormal activity of CUGBP1 in DM1 mice [human skeletal actin mRNA, containing long repeats ( HSA<sup>LR</sup>) model]. Here, we show that the inhibition of GSK3β in young HSA<sup>LR</sup> mice prevents development of DM1 muscle pathology. Skeletal muscle in 1-yr-old HSA<sup>LR</sup> mice, treated at 1.5 mo for 6 wk with the inhibitors of GSK3, exhibits high fiber density, corrected atrophy, normal fiber size, with reduced central nuclei and normalized grip strength. Because CUG-GSK3β-cyclin D3-CDK4 converts the active form of CUGBP1 into a form of translational repressor, we examined the contribution of CUGBP1 in myogenesis using Celf1 knockout mice. We found that a loss of CUGBP1 disrupts myogenesis, affecting genes that regulate differentiation and the extracellular matrix. Proteins of those pathways are also misregulated in young HSA<sup>LR</sup> mice and in muscle biopsies of patients with congenital DM1. These findings suggest that the correction of GSK3β-CUGBP1 pathway in young HSA<sup>LR</sup> mice might have a positive effect on the myogenesis over time.-Wei, C., Stock, L., Valanejad, L., Zalewski, Z.
