Abstract : Central core disease (CCD) is a congenital human myopathy associated with mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1), resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and lower limb deformities. The muscle weakness can be at least partially explained by a reduced magnitude of voltage-gated Ca(2+) release (VGCR). To date, only a few studies have focused on identifying potential therapeutic agents for CCD. Therefore, in this work we investigated the potential use of the calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) to restore VGCR in myotubes expressing CCD RyR1 mutants. We also examined the influence of CCD mutants on Ca(2+)-dependent processes involved in myogenesis (myoblast fusion and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 2 (SERCA2) gene expression). C2C12 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding either wild-type RyR1 or CCD mutants, and then exposed to CGRP (100 nm, 1-4 h). Expression of the I4897T mutant significantly inhibited SERCA2 gene expression and myoblast fusion, whereas the Y523S mutant exerted the opposite effect. Interestingly, both mutants clearly inhibited VGCR (50%), due to a reduction in SR Ca(2+) content. However, no major changes due to CGRP or CCD mutants were observed in I(CaL). Our data suggest that the Y523S mutant results in store depletion via decompensated SR Ca(2+) leak, while the I4897T mutant inhibits SERCA2 gene expression. Remarkably, in both cases CGRP restored VGCR, likely to have been by enhancing phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation, SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) content. Taken together, our data show that in the C2C12 model system, changes in excitation-contraction coupling induced by the expression of RyR1 channels bearing CCD mutations Y523S or I4897T can be reversed by CGRP.
