Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Ninety-eight patients who received prosthodontic treatment for maxillofacial defects were examined clinically and by means of questionnaires and registration of chewing efficiency and occlusal force. Although 30% of the patients stated that they could chew soft food, and one third could not chew the test food (almonds), only 14% said they had a poor chewing ability. The mean occlusal force was small (80 N) but the individual variation was great (median 49 N, maximum 327 N). Despite major defects and poor functional test results, most patients were remarkably well-adapted to their situation and to maxillofacial prosthodontic rehabilitation. Severe signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders were rare.
