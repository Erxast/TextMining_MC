Abstract : Next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed the titin gene (TTN) to be identified as a major contributor to neuromuscular disorders, with high clinical heterogeneity. The mechanisms underlying the phenotypic variability and the dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance are unclear. Titin is involved in the formation and stability of the sarcomeres. The effects of the different TTN variants can be harmless or pathogenic (recessive or dominant) but the interpretation is tricky because the current bioinformatics tools can not predict their functional impact effectively. Moreover, TTN variants are very frequent in the general population. The combination of deep phenotyping associated with RNA molecular analyses, western blot (WB) and functional studies is often essential for the interpretation of genetic variants in patients suspected of titinopathy. In line with the current guidelines and suggestions, we implemented for patients with skeletal myopathy and with potentially disease causing TTN variant(s) an integrated genotype-transcripts-protein-phenotype approach, associated with phenotype and variants segregation studies in relatives and confrontation with published data on titinopathies to evaluate pathogenic effects of TTN variants (even truncating ones) on titin transcripts, amount, size and functionality. We illustrate this integrated approach in four patients with recessive congenital myopathy.
