Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an extremely rare hereditary connective tissue disorder characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes and by progressive heterotopic ossification of striated muscles and soft tissues. We report a case of FOP in a Malian boy and review the clinical and radiographic manifestations of this disorder. The body TDM showed ossifications and calcifications in the muscles of the large rhomboid, the erector muscles of the rachis and the trapezius muscles. Radiography of the dorsolumbar rachis showed paravertebral soft tissue calcification adjacent to intact lumbar vertebrae. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings and demonstration of skeletal malformations. The differential diagnosis of this rare condition from other muscle and joint disease is discussed. There is no effective prevention or treatment. There is a need for a wider knowledge of this condition.
