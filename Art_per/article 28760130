Abstract : Congenital dislocation of the patella is a disorder that presents with dysfunction in extensor mechanism. Although congenital dislocation of the patella mostly occurs in children with genetic disorders, it may also occur in totally healthy children, despite rarely. In this article, we report a 16-year-old male patient who referred to our clinic with complaints of gait disturbance, frequent falls, and muscular weakness in lower extremity. The patient had no complaints during walking, but had difficulty in running and walking up and down the stairs. It was observed that the range of motion of the knee joint was completely painless and the quadriceps muscle strength was evaluated as 3/5. An evaluation of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patella was dislocated. It became clear with magnetic resonance imaging that extensor mechanism was continuous but patellar tendon was not attached to its anatomical position. Surgical treatment was not planned because the patient did not describe any pain complaint and there was no limitation of joint movement, he could walk without support and without device and also refused to be operated. The choice of treatment should be based on the patient's preference, and pain and functional status.
