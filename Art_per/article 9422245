Title : Strokes in childhood.
Date : 1995
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Brain infarcts and brain hemorrhages in patients younger than 20 years are significantly less common than among those older than 65 years; also, their clinical expressions are different from those common to older patients. Congenital defects involving the heart and the arteries supplying the brain are among the most common causes of stroke in the young. In addition to the structural changes affecting the heart and blood vessels, various genetic disorders (hematologic, mitochondrial, and others) are being identified as significant risk factors in an increasing number of young stroke victims.
