Date : 1992
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Migrational disorders are the result of a wide range of fetal diseases that become manifest before midgestation. Recognition may not tell us everything about the etiology of these disorders, but it certainly tells us their time of origin. More diagnostic clues may be added to the case of an individual patient if the type of migrational disorder is taken into consideration.
