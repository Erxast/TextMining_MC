Abstract : Malignant hyperthermia is an autosomal dominant myopathy triggered by inhalational anesthetics and neuromuscular blockers, such as halothane and succinylcholine, which causes temperature increases that may be fatal if not promptly treated. This report aimed at describing anesthesia in a child susceptible to malignant hyperthermia submitted to orthopedic surgery.Female patient, 3 years of age, with congenital hip dislocation and susceptible to malignant hyperthermia, according to anesthetic history, who was submitted to corrective orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl, combined with lumbar epidural anesthesia. Temperature was closely monitored during surgery and in the postoperative period. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and patient was discharged five days later.Combined regional and intravenous anesthesia for the surgical procedure proposed to a patient susceptible to malignant hyperthermia allowed a safe anesthetic approach.
