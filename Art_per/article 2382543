Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Teratologic dislocation of the hip is defined as a congenital dislocation which is irreducible by gentle manipulation at birth. It is often associated with other congenital defects, the most common of which is arthrogryposis. In a series of 25 teratologic dislocations, we studied 17 dislocations that were treated and followed up for an average of 4 years and 6 months (minimum 1 year, maximum 10 years). Clinical and radiological results confirm that the treatment--mainly surgical--can give these children, even arthrogrypotic ones, a congruent and functional hip. This treatment may be recommended for bilateral as well as for unilateral teratologic hip dislocation.
