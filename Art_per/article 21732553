Abstract : S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) deficiency is a rare congenital disorder in methionine metabolism clinically characterized by white matter atrophy, delayed myelination, slowly progressive myopathy, retarded psychomotor development and mildly active chronic hepatitis. In the present study, we utilized a comparative proteomics strategy based on 2-DE/MALDI-MS and LC/ESI-MS to analyze plasma proteins from three AHCY-deficient patients prior to and after receiving dietary treatment designed to alleviate disease symptoms. Obtained results revealed candidate biomarkers for the detection of myopathy specifically associated with AHCY deficiency, such as carbonic anhydrase 3, creatine kinase, and thrombospondin 4. Several proteins mediating T-cell activation and function were identified as well, including attractin and diacylglycerol kinase Î±. Further validation and functional analysis of identified proteins with clinical value would ensure that these biomarkers make their way into routine diagnosis and management of AHCY deficiency.
