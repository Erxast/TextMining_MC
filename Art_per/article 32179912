Abstract : Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in children. While the genetic aberrations underlying CAKUT pathogenesis are increasingly being elucidated, their consequences on a cellular and molecular level commonly remain unclear. Recently, we reported rare heterozygous deleterious LIFR variants in 3.3% of CAKUT patients, including a novel de novo frameshift variant, identified by whole-exome sequencing, in a patient with severe bilateral CAKUT. We also demonstrated CAKUT phenotypes in Lifr-/- and Lifr+/- mice, including a narrowed ureteric lumen due to muscular hypertrophy and a thickened urothelium. Here, we show that both in the ureter and bladder of Lifr-/- and Lifr+/- embryos, differentiation of the three urothelial cell types (basal, intermediate and superficial cells) occurs normally but that the turnover of superficial cells is elevated due to increased proliferation, enhanced differentiation from their progenitor cells (intermediate cells) and, importantly, shedding into the ureteric lumen. Microarray-based analysis of genome-wide transcriptional changes in Lifr-/- versus Lifr+/+ ureters identified gene networks associated with an antimicrobial inflammatory response. Finally, in a reverse phenotyping effort, significantly more superficial cells were detected in the urine of CAKUT patients with versus without LIFR variants indicating conserved LIFR-dependent urinary tract changes in the murine and human context. Our data suggest that LIFR signaling is required in the epithelium of the urinary tract to suppress an antimicrobial response under homeostatic conditions and that genetically induced inflammation-like changes underlie CAKUT pathogenesis in Lifr deficiency and LIFR haploinsufficiency.
