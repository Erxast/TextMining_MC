Abstract : Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is a rare hereditary myopathy characterized by centrally located muscle fiber nuclei. Mutations in the dynamin 2 (DNM2) gene are estimated to account for about 50Â % of CNM cases. Electromyographic recordings in CNM may show myopathic motor unit potentials without spontaneous activity at rest. Myotonic discharges, a distinctive electrical activity caused by membrane hyperexcitability, are characteristic of certain neuromuscular disorders. Such activity has been reported in only one CNM case without a known genetic cause. We sequenced the DNM2 gene and the genes associated with myotonia (CLCN1, SCN4A, DMPK and ZNF9) in a sporadic adult patient with CNM and myotonic discharges. Sequencing the entire coding region and exon-intron boundaries revealed a heterozygous c.1106g-a substitution in exon 8, resulting in a R369Q change in the DNM2. Sequencing the CLCN1, SCN4A, DMPK and ZNF9 genes ruled out mutations in these genes. This is the first report of DNM2-related CNM presenting with myotonia. The diagnosis of CNM should be considered in patients with myotonic discharges of an unknown cause.
