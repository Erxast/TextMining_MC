Abstract : A 13 year-old girl with scoliosis and central core disease is reported. She was noted to have mild psychomotor developmental delay since early infancy. Scoliosis with minimal muscle weakness was noted at about five years old. The neurological examination disclosed absent knee jerk. The spine MRI showed no significant finding. The serum CK revealed 518 U/L. The muscle biopsy obtained from the quadriceps femoris muscle showed Type 1 fiber atrophy and predominance, as is commonly seen in congenital myopathies. Under nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) stains, core structures were identified and the diagnosis of central core disease (CCD) was made. Since kyphoscoliosis usually becomes prominent as muscle weakness progresses to loss of ambulation in other myopathies, the disproportionate spinal involvement in central core disease appears to be a striking feature. We suggest that all patients with idiopathic scoliosis deserve a thorough neurological evaluation if congenital myopathies are suspected. Muscle biopsy should also be recommended for a confirmatory diagnosis even if only minimal muscle weakness present. Besides, early detection of CCD helps us to identify the population who are at a higher risk for malignant hyperthermia.
