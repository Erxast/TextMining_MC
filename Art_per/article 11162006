Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Seven thousand, seven hundred newborn children were examined prospectively to determine the congenital incidence of trigger thumb and finger. No cases were found. The case histories of 43 trigger digit cases (35 trigger thumbs and eight trigger fingers) noted in 40 children diagnosed at our center between 1995 and 1998 were reviewed with special reference to the spontaneous recovery rate, treatment outcome, and age at presentation. Of the 35 thumb cases, 23 underwent surgical release and all responded satisfactorily to surgical treatment. Spontaneous recovery was noted in 12 trigger thumb cases and in all eight trigger finger cases. Trigger finger developed earlier in life than trigger thumb and the spontaneous recovery rate was higher in trigger finger than trigger thumb.
