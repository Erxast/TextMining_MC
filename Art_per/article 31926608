Abstract : Congenital myopathy is a heterogeneous group of muscle disorders characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia. This condition is associated with a range of skeletal, respiratory, and ophthalmologic complications and requires a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach aimed at maximizing the function and independence of patients. One promising direction for therapeutic intervention is physical exercise rehabilitation, given its demonstrated ability to promote muscle and bone health of patients with a variety of neuromuscular conditions. However, there are few data to assist health care professionals identify the optimal physical activity levels and exercise type, including the intensity, frequency, and duration. This lack of empirical evidence is particularly problematic given the fact that inappropriate exercise modes can potentially cause muscle damage in patients with congenital myopathy. In this article, we discuss the rationale behind the incorporation of two types of physical exercises, strength and aerobic training, into the clinical care of patients with congenital myopathy. Given the paucity of literature on the management of congenital myopathy, we review the results of published research on the treatment of both congenital myopathy and other neuromuscular diseases that could provide helpful insights into the physical rehabilitation of patients with congenital myopathy. We also discuss the potential benefits of vibration therapy, which has been studied in patients with other neuromuscular disorders over the last two decades. We conclude by proposing directions for future research on physical rehabilitation of patients with congenital myopathy.
