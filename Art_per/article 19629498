Title : Congenital diaphragmatic hernia with a pure duplication of chromosome 1q: report of the first surviving case.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in multiple malformation syndromes and associations, and has been associated with cytogenetic aberrations on almost every chromosome arm. However, CDH with a duplication of chromosome 1q is very rare in the literature, and all previously reported cases with detailed clinical courses died soon after birth. We present the first surviving case of CDH with a duplication of 1q12-q23, who had arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. CDH patients with a proximal duplication of chromosome 1q may have a chance for survival, and CDH with a duplication of chromosome 1q is not necessarily a lethal association.
