Abstract : Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy, dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type B and CMT2. Here, we report a novel DNM2 mutation in the Pleckstrin homology domain of DNM2 (p.K559del) in a patient with an axonal length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy predominantly affecting the lower limbs. Neuropathy is associated with congenital cataracts, ophthalmoparesis, ptosis and neutropenia. There was no evidence of a skeletal myopathy on EMG or muscle biopsy. We suggest that this constellation of clinical features can help the diagnosis and selection of patients for direct DNM2 genetic analysis.
