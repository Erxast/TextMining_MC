Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a symptom complex of congenital joint contractures associated with neurogenic and myopathic disorders. It is diagnosed at birth and often progresses to a state of significant disability. Pregnancy in a woman with AMC is at high risk due to diminished pulmonary reserve, increased risk of thromboembolism and anesthesia. Successful pregnancy in patients with AMC is very rare and only five cases have been reported in literature. Present case is being reported due to its rarity.
