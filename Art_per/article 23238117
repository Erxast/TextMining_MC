Abstract : Dupuytren's disease in infants has been rarely reported. We present a congenital case with the onset of the disorder since his birth. A 31-month-old boy with congenital flexion contracture of his left long and ring finger was suspected to the diagnosis. To correct the deformity and confirm the diagnosis, fascieotomy was performed. Postoperative histopathological examination proved the diagnosis. No recurrence and functional disturbance of the hand were observed at 21 months' follow-up.
