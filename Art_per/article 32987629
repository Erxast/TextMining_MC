Abstract : Arthrogryposis and macroglossia are congenital pathologies known in several cattle breeds, including Piemontese. As variations in single genes were identified as responsible for arthrogryposis in some breeds, we decided: (i) to test the hypothesis of a similar genetic determinism for arthrogryposis in the Piemontese breed by genotyping affected and healthy animals with a high-density chip and applying genome-wide association study (GWAS), <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) procedures, and (ii) to investigate with the same approach the genetic background of macroglossia, for which no genetic studies exist so far. The study included 125 animals (63 healthy, 30 with arthrogryposis, and 32 with macroglossia). Differently from what reported for other breeds, the analysis did not evidence a single strong association with the two pathologies. Rather, 23 significant markers on different chromosomes were found (7 associated to arthrogryposis, 11 to macroglossia, and 5 to both pathologies), suggesting a multifactorial genetic mechanism underlying both diseases in the Piemontese breed. In the 100-kb interval surrounding the significant SNPs, 20 and 26 genes were identified for arthrogryposis and macroglossia, respectively, with 12 genes in common to both diseases. For some genes (<i>NTN3</i>, <i>KCNH1</i>, <i>KCNH2</i>, and <i>KANK3</i>), a possible role in the pathologies can be hypothesized, being involved in processes related to muscular or nervous tissue development. The real involvement of these genes needs to be further investigated and validated.
