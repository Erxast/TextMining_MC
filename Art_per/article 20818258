Abstract : Amniotic rupture sequence is associated with defects of variable severity and at different sites. Analysis of the literature reveals difficulties in the classification, which, in addition to uncertainties surrounding its causes, make diagnosis of unusual presentations rather difficult. We present an unusual case of a thoracoabdominal restrictive band from the umbilicus to a low-set posterior hairline with severe trapezius contracture, sternoclavicular dislocation, and no associated craniofacial or limb abnormalities. Amnion rupture sequence with adhesion band seems to be the most probable cause of this rare combination of anomalies.
