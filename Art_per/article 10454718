Abstract : Several neuromuscular disorders are associated with reductions in intramuscular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and/or phosphocreatine (PCr). These alterations have been primarily characterized using (31)P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS). We prospectively measured total creatine, PCr, and ATP in muscle biopsies from 81 patients: normal controls (n = 33), mitochondrial cytopathy (n = 8), neuropathic (n = 3), dystrophy/congenital myopathies (n = 7), inflammatory myopathy (n = 12), and miscellaneous myopathies (n = 18) using direct biochemical analysis. Intramuscular concentrations of PCr and ATP were lower for the dystrophy/congenital myopathy, inflammatory myopathy, and mitochondrial disease patients with ragged red fiber (RRF) as compared with normal controls (P < 0.05). Total creatine was lower for the dystrophy/congenital myopathy group as compared with the normal control group (P < 0.05). These values compare favorably to results from other studies using (31)P-MRS and provide external validation for the values obtained using that method. Given the reductions in high-energy phosphate compounds in these patients, there is the potential for therapeutic intervention with creatine monohydrate supplementation.
