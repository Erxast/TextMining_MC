Abstract : Our previous paper presenting electromyographic findings in patients with congenital fiber type disproportion myopathy, confirmed the myogenic character of the disease process. That group of patients was however fairly heterogenous regarding both the clinical features and the morphological changes in muscle fibers (e.g. cases with central cores). In the present study we have examined 13 children with hypotonia and muscle fiber type disproportion operated on in childhood for congenital hip dislocation. In all cases CNEMG and SFEMG with FD estimation was performed in biceps brachii and quadriceps femoris muscles. In all muscles examined either slight EMG changes indicative of myopathy or a normal EMG pattern was found. None of the patients demonstrated an evident increase in FD values. Normal FD and the recruitment pattern proportional to the force of contractures indicate that the normal number of motoneurons is preserved. Accordingly, our present findings confirm the conclusions of our previous paper.
