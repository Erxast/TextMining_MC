Title : I-Z-I complexes in congenital myopathy.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 3-month-old boy with hypotonia at birth succumbed to a congenital myopathy. The major finding in his muscle biopsy corresponded to I-Z-I complexes described previously in embryonic skeletal muscle. A few previous myopathy cases have described findings suggestive of I-Z-I-like complexes. A mutation affecting mononuclear myoblasts or early myotubes was suspected, although an acquired lesion could not be ruled out. The findings may also have been altered by secondary events in this unusual case.
