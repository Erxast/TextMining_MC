Abstract : The treatment of pediatric deformities is relatively common in the typical foot and ankle practice. Talipes calcaneovalgus deformity represents one of the more prevalent deformities. This postural deformity, which is present at birth, is characterized by marked dorsiflexion and valgus position of the foot in relation to the leg. It is essential that an accurate diagnosis is established early and conservative treatment instituted. In most cases, the deformity is highly responsive to conservative therapy consisting of manipulation and casting. Deformity not identified at birth or soon thereafter, or residual deformity treated later in life, presents a greater challenge to the physician. This paper is intended to provide an overview of the deformity of calcaneovalgus including a discussion of etiology, incidence, clinical and radiographic manifestations, differential diagnosis, and recommended treatment. The authors present an unusual case of residual talipes calcaneovalgus left untreated since birth and the approach to management.
