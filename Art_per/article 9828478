Date : 1998
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors reviewed 53 patients with 70 congenital trigger digits. Three of these were seen at an early age. Most "congenital" trigger digits present later than the neonatal period. A clear difference exists between trigger thumbs and trigger fingers. In our series, thumbs were more frequently affected, 30% were bilateral and none resolved spontaneously. The long fingers were less frequently affected, and two of them (28%) recovered without operation. All other children had an operative release of the A1 pulley of the flexor tendon sheath, with excellent results.
