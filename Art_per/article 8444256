Abstract : The objectives of this study were to describe the course of two forms of an hereditary syndrome characterised by congenital cataract, mitochondrial myopathy of heart and skeletal muscle and lactic acidosis. We also sought to determine clinical, physicochemical and histopathological data which might allow early distinction between the two forms. We compared the ages at which clinical and physicochemical signs appeared in 16 patients. In 5 patients, enzyme-histochemical and ultrastructural data of skeletal muscle were available and muscle fibre composition analysed morphometrically. In any particular family only one form of the syndrome occurred. Amongst the patients who did not survive (range 14-34 years) 4 patients died in the neonatal period and 7 died at a median age of 23 years. The median age of the survivors was 19 years (range 15-42 years). Outflow obstruction of the left ventricle was noted in four deceased patients at variable times prior to death. The other deceased patients were not examined, but the cause of death was invariably heart failure. In none of the surviving patients was outflow obstruction noted. Enzyme-histochemical and ultrastructural findings were not specific for the course of the disease. In one biopsy, taken at the age of 3.5 months from a patient who survived, strong lipid accumulation was noted. Morphometric analysis showed proliferation of the mitochondria in muscle fibres, which increased during the course of the disease.
