Abstract : The muscular dystrophies are inherited myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness of variable distribution and severity. They can be subdivided into several groups, including congenital forms, in accordance with the distribution of predominant muscle weakness: Duchenne/Becker; limb-girdle; Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy; Emery-Dreifus; facioscapulohumeral; oculopharyngeal; myotonic dystrophy, et al. Muscular dystrophies are susceptible to perioperative respiratory, cardiac and other complications, such as rhabdomyolysis. Halogenated inhalational anesthetic agents have been implicated as a cause of acute rhabdomyolysis that resembles malignant hyperthermia. Depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs that cause rhabdomyolysis are contraindicated in these patients. Recommendations are proposed for the safe anesthetic management of these patients.
