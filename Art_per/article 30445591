Abstract : Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is the most common defect of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid Î²-oxidation. Patients present with heterogeneous clinical phenotypes affecting heart, liver and skeletal muscle predominantly. The full pathophysiology of the disease is unclear and patient response to current therapeutic regimens is incomplete. To identify additional cellular alterations and explore more effective therapies, mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox homeostasis were assessed in VLCAD-deficient fibroblasts, and several protective compounds were evaluated. The results revealed cellular and tissue changes, including decreased respiratory chain (RC) function, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and altered mitochondrial function and signaling pathways in a variety of VLCAD-deficient fibroblasts. The mitochondrially enriched electron and free radical scavengers JP4-039 and XJB-5-131 improved RC function and decreased ROS production significantly, suggesting that they are viable candidate compounds to further develop to treat VLCAD-deficient patients.
