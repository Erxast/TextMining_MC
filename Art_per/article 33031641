Abstract : Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), or "visceral myopathy," is a severe early onset disorder characterized by impaired muscle contractility in the bladder and intestines. Five genes are linked to MMIHS: primarily ACTG2, but also LMOD1, MYH11, MYLK, and MYL9. Here we describe a three-year-old girl with bilateral hydronephrosis diagnosed at 20Â weeks gestation and congenital mydriasis (both of which have been previously observed among individuals with MMIHS). A clinical diagnosis of MMIHS was made based upon the presence of megacystis, lack of urinary bladder peristalsis, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. After initial testing of ACTG2 was negative, further sequencing and deletion/duplication testing was performed on the LMOD1, MYH11,MYLK, and MYL9 genes. We identified two heterozygous loss of function variants in MYL9: an exon 4 deletion and a nine base pair deletion that removes the canonical splicing donor site at exon 2 (NM_006097.5:c.184+2_184+10del). Parental testing confirmed these variants to be in trans in our proband. To our knowledge, only one other individual with MMIHS has biallelic mutations in MYL9 (a homozygous deletion encompassing exon 4). We suggest MYL9 be targeted on genetic testing panels for MMIHS, smooth muscle myopathies, and cardiovascular phenotypes.
