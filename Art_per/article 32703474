Title : Distal Myopathies.
Date : 2020
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The distal myopathies are a rare and heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders. Patients present with weakness of the hands, distal lower extremities, or both. Age of onset varies from early childhood to late adulthood. Most of the disorders causing distal myopathic weakness are genetically based. The list of genetic disorders associated with distal-onset weakness is ever-expanding and complicated by pronounced genetic heterogeneity, phenotypic variability, and complex multisystem involvement. There are no known effective disease-modifying treatments for the distal myopathies. Evaluation, symptomatic management, and periodic monitoring of patients in a multidisciplinary neuromuscular center are the mainstays of care.
