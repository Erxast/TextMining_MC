Title : Clinical features for prediction of survival in neonatal muscle disease.
Date : 1992 Jul-Aug
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Review of 17 newborns with muscle disease demonstrated that clinical features associated with survival beyond 1 year of age included gestational age of at least 35 weeks and requirement of mechanical ventilation for less than 21 days. In contrast, poor outcome was associated with Apgar scores below 5 at 5 min, pulmonary complications, arthrogryposis, or other congenital anomalies. The incidence of decreased fetal movements, polyhydramnios, hypotonia, and assisted delivery was not statistically different between infants who died early and those who survived beyond 1 year of age. Clinical features of newborns with muscle disease may be useful for prediction of outcome, especially when muscle biopsy abnormalities are nonspecific.
