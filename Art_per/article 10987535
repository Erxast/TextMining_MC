Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Neonatal vascular compromise to limbs has been associated traditionally with perinatal injury of the brachial plexus, fracture of the clavicle or humerus, or iatrogenic causes. Congenital Volkmann's ischemic contracture is an exceptional etiology of ischemic limb in the newborn. Fewer than 10 cases had been described in the literature. The authors report a newborn presenting at birth with partial bluish discoloration of the right forearm. The clinical picture and laboratory studies lead to the diagnosis of congenital Volkmann-Lesser ischemic contracture.
