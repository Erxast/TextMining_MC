Title : Multiple congenital contractures.
Date : 1997
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A cross-sectional study of 28 patients with multiple congenital contractures of miscellaneous origin is presented. We describe the clinical, genetic, and neurological diagnosis and the involvement of upper and lower extremities and spine. All treatments that patients received so far as well as functional outcome were studied. We compared these factors in children with anterior horn cell degeneration (AHCD) or amyoplasia with those of children with contractures of other origin. A correct genetical diagnosis of multiple congenital contracture is important because children with AHCD will need more extensive treatment than others, and their functional outcome seems to be worse.
