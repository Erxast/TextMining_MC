Abstract : Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), which is structurally characterized by the presence of four ankyrin repeat motifs in its central region, is believed to be localized in the nucleus and to participate in the regulation of cardiac-specific gene expression in cardiomyocytes. However, we recently found that CARP was induced in skeletal muscle by denervation, leading us to speculate that CARP may be induced under some pathological conditions. In the present study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of CARP in 11 cases of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and 14 cases of congenital myopathy. In SMA, CARP was expressed selectively in severely atrophic myofibers, suggesting that CARP expression may reflect the status of muscle atrophy. Furthermore, in the congenital myopathies, the expression patterns of CARP were distinct among the subtypes, which included nemaline myopathy, myotubular myopathy, central core disease, and congenital fiber type disproportion. Although CARP was preferentially expressed in severely damaged myofibers in nemaline myopathy, it was not detected in central core disease. These findings suggest that immunohistochemical evaluation of CARP may be helpful in the diagnosis of SMA and the congenital myopathies.
