Title : Congenital myopathy due to phosphorylase deficiency.
Date : 1983
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 4-year-old boy had delayed psychomotor development, proximal weakness, increased serum CK, and myopathic EMG. Muscle biopsy was normal, but histochemical stain for phosphorylase showed no reaction. The enzyme defect was confirmed biochemically and in studies of anaerobic glycolysis in vitro. Glycogen concentration was twice normal. Atypical presentations of myophosphorylase deficiency have included progressive weakness of late onset and fatal infantile myopathy. This patient represents another example of clinical heterogeneity.
