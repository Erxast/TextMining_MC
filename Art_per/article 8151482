Date : 1994
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We describe two infants with congenital myotonic dystrophy that was complicated by persistent pulmonary hypertension. Both infants died of respiratory insufficiency that was unresponsive to ventilatory and pharmacologic support. One of the two infants was supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before the diagnosis of congenital myotonic dystrophy was made.
