Title : Hydrops fetalis associated with congenital myotonic dystrophy.
Date : 1992
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a case of congenital myotonic dystrophy in a newborn infant who presented with hydrops fatalis. Clinical features were hypotonia, generalized edema, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, scalp hematomas, and tented mouth facies. Review of literature shows that congenital myotonic dystrophy is not a rare cause of nonimmune hydrops fetalis as previously thought.
