Title : Trophic muscle regulation in children with congenital cerebral lesions.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A decrease in sarcomere number and hypoextensibility of ankle extensors was observed in certain children with congenital cerebral lesions. This phenomenon was reproducible and reversible in normal animals, i.e. trophic regulation adapted the muscle to the imposed length. The form of the torque-ankle angle curve was studied in 30 children. Its modification after treatment was considered as a sign of muscle adaptation. This adaptation was present in one group of 14 children. The steepness of the curve increased or diminished depending on the initial disorder and the treatment administered. In another group, treatment failed to modify the shape of the curve. In certain cases trophic regulation of the muscle appeared to be absent.
