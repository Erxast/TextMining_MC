Abstract : Patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) are often exposed to ionizing radiations which could be reduced if a noninvasive and reliable diagnostic method is identified. The major aim of this study was to compare the use of chest X-ray (CXR) with lung ultrasound (LUS) in pediatric patients with NMD, to identify pulmonary atelectasis (PA).A prospective study was conducted on children affected by NMD. In all patients who underwent CXR, a LUS was also performed and results compared for the assessment of PA.Forty children affected by NMD were enrolled. Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 was the most common NMD, followed by spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and congenital myopathies. More than half of the subjects presented PA, more prevalent in the lung left lower lobes. LUS agreed with CXR results (negative or positive for atelectasis) in 31 patients (77.5%). In two patients, an agreement evaluation was not possible due to non-conclusive LUS. Conversely, LUS disagreed with CXR in seven patients, four of which were positive for atelectasis. If only complete agreement was considered, the statistical analysis between CXR and LUS showed: LUS sensitivity of 57%, LUS specificity of 82%, positive predictive value 80%, negative predictive value 61%.This study suggests that the use of LUS should be recommended to early identify PA and reduce frequent ionizing exposition of these fragile patients. Finally, our study also suggests that LUS can provide relevant information for clinicians and respiratory physiotherapists.
