Abstract : We describe two brothers with lower facial weakness, highly arched palate, scaphocephaly due to synostosis of the sagittal and metopic sutures, axial hypotonia, proximal muscle weakness, and mild scoliosis. The muscle MRI of the younger sibling revealed a selective pattern of atrophy of the gluteus maximus, adductor magnus and soleus muscles. Muscle biopsy of the younger sibling revealed myofibres with internalized nuclei, myofibrillar disarray, and "corona" fibres. Both affected siblings were found to be compound heterozygous for c.3425G>A (p.Arg1142Gln) and c.1123T>C (p.Cys375Arg) mutations in SCN4A on exome sequencing, and the parents were confirmed carriers of one of the mutations. Electrophysiological characterization of the mutations revealed the Cys375Arg confers full and Arg1142Gln mild partial loss-of-function. Loss of function of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel leads to a decrement of the action potential and subsequent reduction of muscle contraction. The unusual muscle biopsy features suggest a more complex pathomechanism, and broaden the phenotype associated with SCN4A mutations.
