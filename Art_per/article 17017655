Title : Inherited myopathy in a young Great Dane.
Date : 2006
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 3-year-old, male Great Dane was evaluated for an 18-month history of progressive weakness. Histologic evaluation of muscle biopsies revealed distinct cytoarchitectural changes that were indistinguishable from the central "core-like" structures previously described as central core myopathy in this breed. Clinical features of this inherited myopathy are described.
