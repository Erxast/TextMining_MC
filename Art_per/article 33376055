Abstract : Nemaline myopathies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of congenital myopathies, mainly characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency. Here, we report a male foetus of consanguineous parents with a severe congenital syndrome characterized by arthrogryposis detected at 13 weeks of gestation. We describe severe complex dysmorphic facial and musculoskeletal features by post mortem fetal examination confirming the prenatal diagnosis. Histomorphological and ultrastructural studies of skeletal muscle reveal mini-rods in myotubes caused by a novel homozygous splice-site mutation in NEB (NM_001164508, chr2:g.152,417,623C>A GRCh37.p11 | c.19,102-1G>T ENST00000397345.3). No rods were seen in the myocardium. We discuss the relevance of this mutation in the context of nemaline myopathies associated with early developmental musculoskeletal disorders.
