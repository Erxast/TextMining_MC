Abstract : Cutaneous ossifications or osteoma cutis can be found in many syndromes. Primary osteoma cutis, present since birth or the first months of life, in the absence of metabolic disorders or trauma, is found in congenital plate-like osteoma cutis and progressive osseous heteroplasia, coexisting in the latter with deep connective tissue ossifications. This report documents the case of a 7-year-old female with a plate-like cutaneous ossification of the forehead causing aesthetic deformities. Other dermal ossifications in the inguinal and preauricular region, as well as the left hand and a small focus in the extraocular muscles of the left orbit, were also present. These lesions did not show progression, and most of them were present since birth. The lesion of forehead was treated surgically. The lack of progression and the fact that the orbital lesion was solitary still fits the criteria for the diagnosis of plate-like osteoma cutis. Plate-like osteoma cutis and progressive osseous heteroplasia may represent varieties of the same disorder.
