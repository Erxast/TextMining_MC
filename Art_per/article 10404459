Title : Survival of a 30-week baby with congenital myotonic dystrophy initially ventilated for 55 days.
Date : 1999
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In previous reports, duration of initial ventilation exceeding 1 month almost always predicts non-survival of babies with congenital myotonic dystrophy. However, a baby with this condition survived beyond infancy after 55 days' ventilation. We describe this case in detail, explain why the baby survived and highlight the importance of individualized assessment, in addition to applying general prognostic terms described in the literature.
