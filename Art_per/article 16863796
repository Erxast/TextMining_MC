Date : 2006
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Abdominal compartment syndrome is a potential complication of laparotomy, but it is rarely anticipated by thoracic surgeons. We present the case of a 16-year-old girl who manifested this syndrome after emergency repair of a Bochdalek congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Techniques for recognition, measurement, treatment, and prevention are discussed.
