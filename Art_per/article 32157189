Abstract : Previously, intragenic CAMTA1 copy number variants (CNVs) have been shown to cause non-progressive, congenital ataxia with or without intellectual disability (OMIM#614756). However, ataxia, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features were all incompletely penetrant, even within families. Here, we describe four patients with de novo nonsense, frameshift or missense CAMTA1 variants. All four patients predominantly manifested features of ataxia and/or spasticity. Borderline intellectual disability and dysmorphic features were both present in one patient only, and other neurological and behavioural symptoms were variably present. Neurodevelopmental delay was found to be mild. Our findings indicate that also nonsense, frameshift and missense variants in CAMTA1 can cause a spastic ataxia syndrome as the main phenotype.
