Date : 1994
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital deformities of tendons and ligaments are not uncommon in foals. The vast majority of hyperextension deformities are treated successfully with exercise management and extended heel shoes. Successful treatment of contractural deformities depend on the site and severity of the deformity and on the appropriate use of medical, physical, and, possibly, surgical therapy.
