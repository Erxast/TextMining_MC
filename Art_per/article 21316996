Abstract : Kocher-Debré-Sémélaigne syndrome is a rare disease with little literature, which develops with myopathy in infancy associated with neuromuscular alterations, polymyositis with symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, pseudohypertrophy, muscular rigidity and spasms, exercise intolerance, myxoedema, short stature, and cretinism. Male patient aged 18 years old, 1.52 m in height, admitted in the General Hospital of Triângulo Mineiro Federal University on November 11, 2003, complaining of intense diffuse abdominal pain like severe cramps, without triggering factors, associated with asthenia and hyporexia. This seems to be one of the few reports of KDS syndrome diagnoses by autopsy, where alterations in the thyroid gland connected with hypotrophy and probable congenital hypothyroidism were described and resulted in complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemophagocytic syndrome with fast progression to death of an 18-year-old patient.
