Abstract : Torticollis is a common neck deformity in both newborn and older children. The various causes of the abnormal posturing of the head differ in severity, long-term consequences and their treatment.This article gives an overview of the differential diagnoses of torticollis in children and current literature, and provides insight into our diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm.A distinction is drawn between congenital and acquired deformities and whether or not they are painful. Most commonly, children present with a congenital muscular torticollis, which has an estimated incidence of 0.3 to 1.9%. The main differential diagnosis of congenital muscular torticollis is Klippel-Feil syndrome. Acquired torticollis often has more severe causes and always needs a thorough diagnostic clarification.The knowledge of possible causes and their treatment is essential to provide adequate care for affected children and their families and to prevent long-term consequences.
