Title : Spastic paraparesis associated with portal-systemic venous shunting due to congenital hepatic fibrosis.
Date : 1992
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a case of progressive spastic paraparesis in a 45-year-old man with total portal-systemic shunting, which developed spontaneously due to congenital hepatic fibrosis. Cellular functions of the liver, except for an elevated blood ammonia level, were within normal limits, as is usual in congenital hepatic fibrosis. This case shows that spastic paraparesis following portal-systemic shunting may occur without liver failure.
