Title : 'Cap myopathy': case report of a family.
Date : 2006
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report the observation of an 18-year-old girl, whose clinical presentation was very suggestive of a congenital myopathy with neonatal onset. A congenital myopathy had been already diagnosed in her brother and in addition her half-cousin died diagnosed with a severe nemaline myopathy at age 4 years. A muscle biopsy performed on both siblings revealed histological and ultrastructural features of 'cap myopathy'. This case report suggests that 'cap myopathy' and some cases of nemaline myopathy with neonatal onset might be two phenotypic expressions of the same genetic disorder. These two entities could therefore, perhaps, be regarded as 'Z-line disorders' possibly caused by defective myofibrillogenesis.
