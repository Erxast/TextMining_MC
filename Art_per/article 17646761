Abstract : Studies on ventricular septal defects closure by catheterization confirm its feasibility without reporting clearly the indications and difficulties encountered.From 2001 to end-2006, 22 patients benefited from 26 ventricular septal defects closure (15 muscular and 7 membranous) at a median age and weight of 2.1 years and 12.5 kg, respectively. A perventricular catheterization was performed in 2 cases. Eighteen patients (82%) benefited from 21 prostheses with success. The closure was associated to surgery in 9 cases (41%) whereas it substituted surgery in the other 13 cases (59%). The median duration of the procedure was significantly longer in case of muscular ventricular septal defects (215 min (175-510) vs. 170 min (120-225), p=0.04). Major complications are reported in 5 cases out of 26 catheterization (19%), including one death related to conduction block, occurring after the implantation of two prostheses in a patient with aortopulmonary transposition. All other associated cardiac diseases have been corrected. A prosthetic emboli occurred in one case, 1.5 months after implantation. It had been retrieved by catheterization. Two patients died afterwards from non-procedure-related causes. After a median follow-up of 1.1 years, the 17 other patients remained asymptomatic. One child with a perimembranous prosthesis presents a paroxystic atrio-ventricular block.Even though indispensable for the curative treatment of several congenital cardiac diseases including non-operable ventricular septal defects, this procedure is related to a substantial rate of mortality and morbidity. The risk of atrio-ventricular block must be adequately considered in case of membranous ventricular septal defects.
