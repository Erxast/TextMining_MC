Abstract : The authors present a rare case of a male infant aged 5 1/2 months with muscular contractures, hypotonia and areflexia. Two male siblings died with the same clinical picture. The microscopic findings of several spinal cord specimens are typical for Werding-Hoffman amylotrophia spinalis. The microscopical aspects are suggestive for neurogenic atrophy of muscular fibres with interstitial myositic process. It is proposed to include the present case in X-linked form of infantile spinal muscular atrophy.
