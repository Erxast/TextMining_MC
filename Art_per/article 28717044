Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Thomas and colleagues (pp. 1122-1133) demonstrate severe dysregulation of developmentally regulated alternative splicing and polyadenylation in congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM). In doing so, they also highlight the importance of these post-transcriptional processes during normal fetal muscle development. Finally, they generate and characterize a mouse model of CDM that lacks all three Muscleblind-like proteins.
