Abstract : Trismus is a problem commonly encountered by the dental practitioner. It has a number of potential causes, and its treatment will depend on the cause. However, there are very few reports of trismus due to fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) following third molar surgery.FOP is a rare human genetic disorder with characteristic clinical features like progressive formation of extraskeletal bone or heterotopic ossification and congenital malformation of the great toes.It is troublesome to the maxillofacial surgeon, that minimal manipulation and minor surgery can induce bone formation in soft tissues of the head and neck region, particularly the masticatory muscles and the temporomandibular joint. This paper presents a case of severe trismus following third molar extraction, intractable by routine treatment methods, which was later diagnosed as FOP.
