Abstract : The LH-RH test was performed in 62 mainly prepuberal children. A dose of 25 mug/20 kg was given intravenously between 10 and 12a.m. Prepuberal healthy boys between 1 11/12 and 9 7/12 years of age reacted with a fourhold increase of LH. Prepuberal boys with an unilaterally undescended testicle showed no difference in LH response from normal. Even a low increase in LH may be followed by spontaneous puberty in children with pituitary dwarfism. The LH response in children with craniopharyngeoma was heterogeneous and appeared to depend on location of tumor and extent of operation. Birdheaded dwarfism and small stature due to steroid administration and due to unknown etiology showed normal LH responses for age. Cases with anorchia and myotonic dystrophy had an excessive LH increase. The LH response in children with Fanconi's anemia and undescended testicles and in otherwise healthy boys with undescended testicles was normal for age. A case of untreated adrenogenital syndrome without salt loss had a presumably normal increase of LH when related to bone age. Primary and pituitary hypothyroidism was shown to have a higher than normal output of LH. A boy with a tumor the 3rd ventricle hat basal levels of LH that were extremely elevated and associated with precocious puberty and diabetes insipidus. A newborn infant with anencephalus showed no increase of LH and LH-RH injection.
