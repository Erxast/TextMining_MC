Abstract : Hohmann's operation of hammer toes and claw toes will produce a poor result if there is a contracture due to hyperextension in the metatarsophalangeal joint. In such cases, preference should be given to the operation according to Taylor (resection arthrodesis of the first or, in rarer cases, of the second interphalangeal joint, dorsal incision of the capsule of the metatarsophalangeal joint, if necessary elongation of the extensor tendon, intramedually fixation by Kirschner wire). In case the operated toe points rigidly to dorsal or hangs limply as a result of Hohmann's operation, a cosmetically and functionally entirely satisfactory result can be achieved by means of operative mobilisation of this preoperated toe and by producing a cutaneously syndactylia with the next, smaller toe. - If a hammer toe is dislocated in the metatarsophalangeal joint, removing the base according to Gocht should be combined with an operative syndactylia to guide and hold the toe accurately in line with the other toes.
