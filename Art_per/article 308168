Abstract : Early diagnosis and treatment is of decisive importance for the prognosis of many orthopedic diseases in infancy, especially of congenital skeletal lesions. Taking as examples deformities of the foot, hip dysplasia and luxation and infantile scoliosis, the principles of diagnosis and guide lines for therapy are indicated. Diseases of the locomotor apparatus can be considerably improved and late lesions to a great extent prevented by early recognition and treatment combined with good interdisciplinary cooperation.
