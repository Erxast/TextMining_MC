Abstract : Central core disease is a congenital myopathy characterized by generalized hypotonia, muscle weakness and presence of central cores on muscle biopsy. It generally presents during infancy. It is familial with autosomal dominant inheritance [Chromosome 19q13.1; Gene Locus RyR1 (Ryanodine receptor gene)]. We report here two cases of central core disease in a 3-year-old male child and 8 year old female child.
