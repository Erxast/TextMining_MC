Title : Myopathy with core-like structures in a dog.
Date : 1987
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Core-like structures were seen histologically in many of the fibres of the triceps and biceps femoris muscles of an 18-months-old male Great Dane with muscle weakness and moderate proximal muscular atrophy. The structures were lightly staining and lacked cross-striations. Some contained vacuoles and nuclei. Scattered necrotic and presumably regenerating fibres were also present. Ultrastructurally, the cores contained disarrayed filament bundles attached to thickened Z-lines which were compatible with the rods of rod myopathies. The condition was not fully characterized, but has certain similarities to a group of rare human congenital muscular disorders which includes central core disease.
