Date : 1994
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 45-yr-old Japanese woman with multiseptate gallbladder, a quite rare congenital anomaly, is presented. Her epigastric pain, with a 35-yr history, was relieved by cholecystectomy. The septa were present only at the neck portion of the gallbladder and were lined by mucosal epithelium containing a muscular layer continuous to the gallbladder wall. A review of 26 patients (including the present case) reported in the world literature revealed that only two of them had such partial involvement at the infundibulum of the gallbladder.
