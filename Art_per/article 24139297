Abstract : Congenital torticollis is characterized by shortening and fibrosis of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle detected at birth or shortly after birth. This leads to a lateral inclination of the head to the ipsilateral shoulder and chin deviation to the opposite side. When diagnosed early, most cases can be conservatively managed with excellent results. In neglected adult cases, the treatment of this entity is more controversial. A review of the different treatment options in neglected adult cases of congenital torticollis is presented, and a case successfully treated by SCM bipolar release is reported. A 35-year-old woman diagnosed with congenital torticollis was referred to the authors' department. She had been diagnosed at 32 years of age and had been conservatively treated, with no success. Physical examination showed a posterior region of the left SCM muscle hard to palpation, with head tilt to the same side and chin deviation to the right. Bipolar release of the SCM muscle was performed under general anesthesia using the harmonic scalpel. Immobilization with a brace was applied during the first 2 weeks and manual stretching was performed after removal of the brace. Head tilt and movement limitation were resolved, achieving good functional and cosmetic results. Although the best treatment results in congenital torticollis are achieved during the first years of childhood, bipolar release of the SCM muscle followed by postsurgical physical therapy can be effective in neglected adult cases.
