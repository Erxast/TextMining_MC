Date : 1997
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The clinical features of seven children with myositis ossificans (circumscripta and progressiva) and radiographic signs of the disease are described. We recommend systematic radiological examination to seek other skeletal malformations for congenital hallux valgus in young children, for it may be the first sign of a myositis ossificans progressiva. The "zone phenomenon" observed on histology, along with differential diagnosis and evolution, is documented. The necessity of a biopsy and different forms of treatment are discussed.
