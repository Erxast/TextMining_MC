Abstract : Although the neurological defects associated with cerebral palsy are not progressive, secondary musculoskeletal disorders due to growth and gravity are variable. In the clinical analysis of spastic foot deformities different mechanisms that produce a variety of deformities have to be analyzed. The goals of surgical treatment are correction of the deformity, reestablishment of stability of the foot and preservation of functionally important ranges of motion and muscle strength. The most common spastic foot deformities are equinus, planovalgus, equinovarus and calcaneus. For treatment soft tissue surgery, such as muscle lengthening and transfer together with bone surgery, such as osteotomy or arthrodesis are used and combinations of these methods are often required. Subsequently postoperative plasters are necessary followed by dynamic orthotic management.
