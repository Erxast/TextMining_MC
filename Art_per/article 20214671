Abstract : Five patients were reported in our congenital anomaly registry who had six hands in total with muscular hyperplasia, aberrant muscles, ulnar drift of the fingers in the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints, flexion contractures of the MP joints, and enlargement of the metacarpal spaces. Thirty patients with unilateral involvement of this condition have been reported previously. We reviewed these cases and found that the condition varied in severity and that it was reported using different names. However, this condition seems different from true macrodactyly and multiple camptodactyly, including windblown hand, and seems to be an isolated entity of congenital upper limb anomaly. The authors recommend 'aberrant muscle syndrome' or 'accessory muscle syndrome' as a diagnostic name, because this seems to be the most common pathological finding in this condition.
