Abstract : Recessive mutations in the MSTO1 gene, encoding for a mitochondrial distribution and morphology regulator, have been recently described in a very limited number of patients with multisystem involvement, mostly characterized by myopathy or dystrophy, cerebellar ataxia, pigmentary retinopathy and raised creatine kinase levels. Here we report an additional patient with recessive MSTO1-related muscular dystrophy (MSTO1-RD), and clinical and radiological evidence of progressive cerebellar involvement. Whole-exome sequencing identified two novel MSTO1 missense variants, c.766C > T (p. (Arg256Trp) and c.1435C > T (p. (Pro479Ser), predicted as damaging by in silico tools. We also report a distinct pattern of selective involvement on muscle MRI in MSTO1-RD. This case confirms a consistent MSTO1-related neuromuscular phenotype and in addition suggests a progressive neurological component at least in some patients, in keeping with the mitochondrial role of the defective protein.
