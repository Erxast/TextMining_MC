Abstract : A 17-year-old boy, who had complained of pain for many years, had an anomalous branch from the dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve which passed ulnar to the pisiform bone and was compressed by the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon. The symptoms were relieved completely by decompression of this nerve.
