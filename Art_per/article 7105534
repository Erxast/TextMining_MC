Abstract : The hypermobility syndrome, also known as congenital laxity of ligaments and joints, occurs as an isolated condition. The genetic background is distinct from that found in other connective tissues disorders. Although joint hypermobility is relatively common in the general population, reports of musculoskeletal complaints are infrequent. An analysis of 100 consecutive cases with various musculoskeletal complaints associated with joint hypermobility demonstrated differing patterns of presentation. One group had mild musculoskeletal complaints of long duration, while another had acute episodes of pain at various sites. A third group had combined features of the first two groups. Many of the patients had complaints referable to feet and calves, while a number related to problems due to patellar hypermobility. The treatment is exercise to develop protective reflex reactions and to strengthen the surrounding musculature. Surgery must be advocated with care and is reserved for patients with secondary arthrosis.
