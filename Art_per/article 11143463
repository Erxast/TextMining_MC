Title : Pelvic tilt in neuromuscular disorders.
Date : 2000
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The pelvic tilt is part of a complex deformity in which both the spine and the hip are involved. By viewing the different planes and analyzing the deforming forces, four different types of pelvic tilt in combination with spinal and hip deformities can be identified. In spina bifida patients congenital deformities of the spine may add to the progression of scoliosis. Analyzing our own patients we found that certain types of pelvic tilt can be related to certain neuromuscular diseases. Moreover our results show that the pelvic tilt can be effectively corrected by spinal surgery, whereas no effect of hip surgery could be demonstrated.
