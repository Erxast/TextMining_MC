Abstract : A 27-year-old man developed gait disturbance over a three-year period. Histochemical analysis suggested nemaline bodies, type I fiber atrophy and type II fiber hypertrophy. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a severe degree of homogenous hyperintensity in the soleus muscle. Fat-suppression MRI exhibited marked diffuse hypointensity in the soleus muscle. MRIs demonstrated unusual fatty proliferation of the soleus muscle. Fat-suppression MRI of skeletal muscles is beneficial in evaluating the accurate topography and degree of fatty infiltration. Radiological patterns of muscle damage are variable in patients with congenital nemaline myopathy, similar to the heterogeneous clinical aspects.
