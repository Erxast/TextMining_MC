Abstract : In Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AMC) feet deformations are frequent. They have form of talipes equinovarus, or less frequently of plano-valgus. The study included influence of various surgical techniques on final result of foot treatment in arthrogryposis. The aim of the study was to analyse errors in classification and surgical technique influencing the final result. Between 1986 and 2004 21 AMC children were surgically treated. In all of the patients the disease was accompanied by heavy feet deformations: 38 talipes equinovarus deformations and 1 plano-valgus. Age of the treated children was between 7 months and 4 years. All feet required surgery. Follow-up period was 3 to 20 years, mean 12.5 years. During the follow-up examination the following elements were evaluated: foot appearance, gait mechanics, foot load level, wearing commercial shoes or orthopaedic equipment. Additionally radiography of feet in AP and lateral projection was performed. Posterior liberation was performed in 21 feet, peritarsal reposition in 18 feet. In case of 13 feet the primary correction was satisfactory. In the remaining 26 feet re-surgeries were necessary, including astrogolectomy in 9 feet. 13 good results were obtained--in which feet were properly loaded, adapted to common shoes and painless. 15 satysfying results were obtained--the feet required orthopaedic shoes; and 11 bad results, where temporary foot pain additionally occurred. Excessively conservative primary surgery in case of heavy foot deformations was a cause for multiple re-surgeries.
