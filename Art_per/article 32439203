Abstract : The collagen VI-related muscular dystrophies in people include a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from the severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy to the mild Bethlem myopathy. Clinical features are attributable to both muscle and connective tissue and include progressive muscle weakness and respiratory failure, hyperlaxity of distal joints, and progressive contracture of large joints. Here we describe two different COL6A3 pathogenic variants in Labrador Retriever dogs that result in autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant congenital myopathies with hyperlaxity of distal joints and joint contracture, similar to the condition in people.
