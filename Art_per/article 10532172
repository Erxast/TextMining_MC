Abstract : Two sibs are reported with severe developmental retardation combined with the clinical triad of camptodactyly, whistling face and Pierre Robin sequence as clinical signs of fetal hypokinesia. In spite of tracheotomy, the first child of the family died 10 hours after birth. A sister of this child was born 1 year later. During pregnancy prenatal diagnosis of hydrocephaly was made by ultrasonographic examination. MRI scan showed holoprosencephaly. At 15 months of age psychomotor development is severely impaired, birth and length are delayed.
