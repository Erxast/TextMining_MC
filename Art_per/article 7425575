Title : Congenital stiff-man syndrome.
Date : 1980
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A second large family with a dominantly inherited benign disorder resembling the stiff-man syndrome is reported. The infants are markedly hypertonic at birth, but their tone becomes almost normal by 3 years of age. Stiffness reappears at adolescence, often precipitated by sudden movement or cold, but remains mild when compared with the sporadic disorder.
