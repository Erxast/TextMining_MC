Abstract : The salient features are described of the psychomotor treatment given to two sisters: SA aged 11 yrs 5 months and MGA aged 9 yrs 9 months both affected with aspecific congenital myopathy and under medical treatment since they were 3 months old. These two cases were selected as examples for the following reasons: (1) they may offer the opportunity to highlight what should be the focal objective of all treatment of myopathic children whatever the syndrome involved, namely to ensure that the children retain capacities required for normal social life as long as possible and to help them retain the essential physical capabilities required for everyday life; (2) because the slower course of this type of myopathy permits the gradual implementation of a diversified treatment protocol in the various social contexts (family, school, play groups) in which these patients are able to lead a life whose limitations are scarcely visible for a long time. Experience in the treatment of these two cases confirms that the role of Psychomotor Education in the treatment of myopathy cases is essentially that of teaching the child to be aware of and responsible for its own movements as the disease progresses, while showing it how touse all its available sensomotorial instruments to counteract its muscular inadequacies which progressively damage the child's body image. Psychomotor education also provides the child with the self-assurance it needs in order to retain its autonomy within the framework of a knowledgeable and motivated family.
