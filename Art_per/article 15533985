Abstract : Bilateral bifid mandibular condyles are rare and may appear as a congenital or developmental anomaly. A case of bilateral bifid mandibular condyles is reported. The patient had no history of trauma and no link was apparent with respect to the patient's medical history. In this case, the condition was an incidental panoramic radiographic finding. Magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed bilateral anterior disc displacement without reduction. The radiographic appearance of this anomaly and the literature on bilateral bifid condyles are reviewed.
