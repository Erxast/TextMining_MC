Title : Ulnar ray deficiency.
Date : 1998
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Longitudinal deficiencies of the ulna are very rare deformities. Despite the cosmetic appearance, patients usually have very functional extremities. The limb function has been adversely related to ipsilateral hand deformities and radiohumeral synostosis. Surgical treatment should be aimed at correcting such deformities. It is prudent to wait and observe patients before definitive wrist or forearm treatment is recommended.
