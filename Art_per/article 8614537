Abstract : We report a 31-year-old man with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy who had congenital anomalies and mental retardation. Southern blot analysis, using the probe p13E-11, displayed an abnormal EcoRI DNA fragment that reflect DNA rearrangements in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. In addition, high-resolution cytogenetic study revealed an interstitial deletion of the short arm chromosome 9: 46,XY,del(9)(p.22.1p24.1).
