Abstract : We generated a novel monoclonal antibody, DAG-6F4, against alpha-dystroglycan which immunolabels the sarcolemma in human muscle biopsies. Its seven amino-acid epitope, PNQRPEL, was identified using phage-displayed peptides and is located immediately after the highly-glycosylated mucin domain of alpha-dystroglycan. On Western blots of recombinant alpha-dystroglycan, epitope accessibility was reduced, but not entirely prevented, by glycosylation. DAG-6F4 immunolabelling was markedly reduced in muscle biopsies from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients consistent with disruption of the dystroglycan complex. In a range of dystroglycanopathy patients with reduced/altered glycosylation, staining by DAG-6F4 was often less reduced than staining by IIH6 (antibody against the glycan epitope added by LARGE and commonly used to identify glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan). Whereas IIH6 was reduced in all patients, DAG-6F4 was hardly changed in a LARGE patient, less reduced than IIH6 in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I, but as reduced as IIH6 in some congenital muscular dystrophy patients. Although absence of the LARGE-dependent laminin-binding site appears not to affect alpha-dystroglycan stability at the sarcolemma, the results suggest that further reduction in aDG glycosylation may reduce its stability. These studies suggest that DAG-6F4 may be a useful addition to the antibody repertoire for evaluating the dystroglycan complex in neuromuscular disorders.
