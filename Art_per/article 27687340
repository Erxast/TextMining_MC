Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy (DM), though rare, can significantly complicate anesthesia due to muscular and extra-muscular involvement. When this condition is compounded by a pheochromocytoma, anesthetizing such patients becomes extra challenging. We present a case report of a 61-year-old lady with congenital DM, with the whole gamut of associated features, was diagnosed with a noradrenaline secreting paraganglionoma following investigation of refractory hypertension. We anesthetized her for an open resection of the lesion. The conduct of anesthesia and recovery of this patient is described. Our experience suggests that anesthetizing these patients though challenging can be safely managed with relaxant general anesthesia and epidural analgesia with meticulous care pre, intra and post-surgical intervention.
