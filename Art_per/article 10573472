Abstract : DM locus-associated homeodomain protein (DMAHP), a newly recognized homeodomain protein, is a candidate flanking gene and expressed in various tissues. We examined the expression of the DMAHP in tissues from a congenital myotonic dystrophy patient in comparison to that of control tissues by using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Reduced expression of DMAHP was observed in tissues from the patient with congenital myotonic dystrophy. This finding supports that reduced expression of DMAHP is related to the CTG repeat expansion.
