Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a multisystemic disorder caused by microsatellite expansion mutations in two unrelated genes leading to similar, yet distinct, diseases. DM disease presentation is highly variable and distinguished by differences in age-of-onset and symptom severity. In the most severe form, DM presents with congenital onset and profound developmental defects. At the molecular level, DM pathogenesis is characterized by a toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism that involves the transcription of noncoding microsatellite expansions. These mutant RNAs disrupt key cellular pathways, including RNA processing, localization, and translation. In DM, these toxic RNA effects are predominantly mediated through the modulation of the muscleblind-like and CUGBP and ETR-3-like factor families of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Dysfunction of these RBPs results in widespread RNA processing defects culminating in the expression of developmentally inappropriate protein isoforms in adult tissues. The tissue that is the focus of this review, skeletal muscle, is particularly sensitive to mutant RNA-responsive perturbations, as patients display a variety of developmental, structural, and functional defects in muscle. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of DM1 and DM2 clinical presentation and pathology as well as the underlying cellular and molecular defects associated with DM disease onset and progression. Additionally, fundamental aspects of skeletal muscle development altered in DM are highlighted together with ongoing and potential therapeutic avenues to treat this muscular dystrophy.
