Abstract : Bronchogenic cyst (BC) is a rare congenital developmental abnormality. BCs are usually encountered in the mediastinum, but ectopic BCs are rare. We present a case of BC located within the diaphragm in an adult female patient. The lesion was successfully resected via thoracotomy. Diagnosis was confirmed by pathology.
