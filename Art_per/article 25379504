Abstract : Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) and craniosynostosis are diseases that cause plagiocephaly and craniofacial asymmetry in children. In our literature review, we did not find any report of concurrent manifestation of CMT and craniosynostosis. A 41-month-old boy visited our hospital with left torticollis, right laterocollis, and craniofacial asymmetry as the main findings. During clinical examination, prominent right sternocleidomastoid muscle and limited range of motion of the neck were noted, and right CMT was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging of the neck. Three-dimensional computed tomography of the skull, which was conducted due to the unusual appearance of the skull with a large head circumference, mild brachycephaly, as well as left plagiocephaly, revealed premature closure of the sagittal suture. Thus, we report the first case that showed concurrence of CMT and sagittal synostosis. We recommend that concurrently manifested craniosynostosis needs to be examined if the subject with CMT displays unusual craniofacial asymmetry to a greater extent than deformational plagiocephaly.
