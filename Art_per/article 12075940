Abstract : Radiologic and pathologic findings correlate well in many pediatric neurologic disorders. However, there are some exceptions. Radiologic techniques are unable to visualize or identify pathologic changes in some diseases (e.g. status marmoratus and subdural fluid collection), whereas pathologic examination fails to clarify the histologic substrate of radiologic abnormalities in other conditions (e.g. Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy and neurofibromatosis type 1). Although studies to solve these issues have met with practical difficulties, important progress has recently been made on some disorders such as Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy and acute necrotizing encephalopathy.
