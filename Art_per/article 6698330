Title : Dynamic EMG findings in varus hindfoot deformity and spastic cerebral palsy.
Date : 1984
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Dynamic electromyography was used to examine the activity of muscles of 26 children with varus hindfoot deformities as a result of spastic cerebral palsy. Four different patterns of inappropriate muscle activity involving the tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, gastrocnemius and soleus were seen during walking. Dynamic electromyographic techniques can be very helpful in identifying the specific muscular aberrations which contribute to this deformity.
