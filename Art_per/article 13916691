Title : Myotonia in a horse.
Date : 1962
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital myotonia, similar to that which has been reported in humans and in goats, is here reported for the first time in another species. Evidence is given to show (i) that the myotonic phenomenon is present despite complete block of neuromuscular transmission; (ii) prior to injection of curare, synchronous activity of muscle fibers may result not only from ephaptic stimulation of neighboring fibers but also from reflex firing; and (iii) water deprivation does not relieve the myotonia.
