Abstract : Central core disease (CCD) and nemaline rod myopathy are generally considered two genetically and histologically distinct disorders. CCD is defined by the presence of well-demarcated round cores within most myofibers. Nemaline rod myopathy is distinguished by the presence of characteristic nemaline bodies within myofibers. The simultaneous occurrence of both cores and rods in the same muscle biopsy has been described, but no gene mutations have been reported yet for this condition.To describe a family containing 16 affected individuals in six generations with an autosomal dominant congenital myopathy that shows clinical and histologic features of both CCD and nemaline myopathy, and to determine the genetic etiology and protein composition of the cores/rods in this family.The results of linkage analyses excluded involvement of the two autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy loci on chromosome 1, but were consistent with a localization of the disease gene at the CCD locus on chromosome 19q13.1 (ryanodine receptor). SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing identified a novel Thr4637Ala mutation in the transmembrane region of the ryanodine receptor protein. Immunofluorescence studies of patient muscle biopsies showed the central cores to stain for ryanodine receptor.These data suggest that the occurrence of nemaline bodies can be a secondary feature of CCD, and that genetic studies on previously reported core/rod families should be targeted to the ryanodine receptor locus. The results of the immunofluorescence studies suggest that the cores contain excess abnormal ryanodine receptor protein.
