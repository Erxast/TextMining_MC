Abstract : Complex glycerol kinase deficiency usually presents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, glycerol kinase deficiency and adrenal hypoplasia congenital. We describe a follow-up patient with complex glycerol kinase deficiency who had appropriate intrauterine development, but who at 1 month of age manifested severe growth delay and psychomotor retardation. Targeted therapy did not bring about the regression of symptoms: both bodyweight and height were below the 3rd centile until 8 years of age, and his Griffith's Mental Development scale score was 71 at age 5 years.
