Abstract : Defects in mitochondrial enzymes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase, cause hereditary disorders which lead to modifications in cellular pH due to the accumulation of pyruvate and lactic acid. Mitochondrial diseases include severe neonatal diseases and less severe forms of adult diseases. We report the case of lactic acidosis in a newborn girl who was delivered at 36 weeks of gestation and who died 3 months after birth. Her family history revealed a relative with tetraparesis and mental retardation. Her clinical findings, such as tonic-clonic convulsions and accumulation of pyruvate and lactic acid in blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid, were refractory to treatment and developed soon after birth. Ultrasound scans of the brain some days before death revealed cerebral atrophy with ventricular dilatation and thinning of the corpus callosum and septum pellucidum. The clinical diagnosis of metabolic lactic acidosis was confirmed by macroscopic, microscopic and ultrastructural findings seen at autopsy. On macroscopic examination, the heart was hypertrophic, and the brain was atrophic with ventricular dilatation and thinning of corpus callosum. Small cystic lesions were present in the basal ganglia. On microscopic examination, the latter were characterized by loss of neurons, gliosis and capillary proliferation. Ultrastructural examination of the heart and skeletal muscle showed lysis of myofibrils, mitochondrial pleomorphism and hyperplasia, and crystalline inclusion in mitochondria and in the matrix compartment. In reporting this case, we emphasize the importance of accurate postmortem examination and clinical data for the diagnosis of metabolic lactic acidosis.
