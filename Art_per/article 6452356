Abstract : Ultrasound was used for the diagnosis of muscle haematomas in seventeen patients with congenital clotting abnormalities. Fifteen patients had haematomas in the extremities or the gluteal muscles, whereas in four cases there was retroperitoneal bleeding. In three of the nineteen examinations there was no sonographic evidence of recent bleeding at the first attempt, but in sixteen cases the size, localisation and relationship to neighbouring organs could be demonstrated. It was possible to distinguish between localised haematomas and diffuse ones. Comparison of the two sides was used with semi-quantitative evaluation of the amplitude profile. The condition in the extremities favours ultrasound examination and makes it possible to use high frequencies in order to achieve better resolution; the diagnosis of bleeding into the retroperitoneal space may be difficult. At times other methods of examination, particularly computer tomography, may have to be used.
