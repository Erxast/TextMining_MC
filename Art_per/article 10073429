Title : Cardiac manifestations of congenital fiber-type disproportion myopathy.
Date : 1999
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Cardiac involvement has not been a reported feature of congenital fiber-type disproportion myopathy. We describe two children, aged 13 years and 1 year, respectively, who presented with serious cardiac symptomatology in conjunction with congenital fiber-type disproportion. One child developed dilated cardiomyopathy and medically intractable congestive heart failure necessitating cardiac transplantation at the age of 13 years. The second (unrelated) child developed atrial fibrillation with rapid atrioventricular conduction requiring treatment with digoxin. Skeletal muscle biopsy findings in both children showed congenital fiber-type disproportion with no evidence of a structural, dystrophic, or metabolic myopathy. Adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) reacted sections showed type I hypotrophy with a predominance of type I fibers, confirmed by histogram analysis. Examination of the heart from patient 1 at the time of transplantation confirmed dilated cardiomyopathy with hypertrophic myocardiocytes. Although cardiomyopathy is commonly associated with other childhood myopathies, to our knowledge it has not been a feature in reported cases of congenital fiber-type disproportion. We recommend close cardiac assessment, with annual electrocardiograms, of children with congenital fiber-type disproportion.
