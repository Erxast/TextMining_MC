Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a progressive syndrome characterized by deformed and stiff joints, atrophy or absence of muscles, contracture and thickening of the capsular articular and periarticular tissue, and normal psychic status.A retrospective, descriptive, evidence level HI study was conducted on the surgical management of patients with Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and congenital adducted thumb between January 2005 and December 2010. Twenty-seven opening procedures were performed in 16 patients with a dorsoradial index finger flap technique. In 80% of patients the dominant hand was operated first; patients included nine males and seven females; the operated hands included 15 right and 12 left hands.Flap design permits better advancement and space deepening, and cosmetic improvement. The mean preoperative first and second intermetacarpal angle was 20.5 degrees on average, with a minimum of 14 degrees and a maximum of 27 degrees. The mean postoperative first and second intermetacarpal angle was 50 degrees, with a minimum of 36 degrees and a maximum of 65 degrees. This was observed at the clinic with active thumb extension as well as proper thumb apposition.Flap design permits better advancement and space deepening, with a better balance between flexors and extensors. All patients had better limb function and cosmetic improvement.
