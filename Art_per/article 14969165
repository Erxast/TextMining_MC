Abstract : The aim of the study was to discuss the role of stem cells in the organism. The paper presents the significance of stem cells in the treatment of many diseases, such as hematopoietic system disorders, muscular dystrophies, Parkinson disease, and congenital immunodeficiency syndromes. The results of investigations on stem cells carried out in recent years allow to presume, that the usage of stem cells will turn out to be a breakthrough in the history of medicine. Umbilical cord blood can be the source of stem cells, which is now underestimated and very often removed.
