Title : Foot and ankle deformities in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.
Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : When 51 patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita followed an average of 12 years were reviewed, talipes equinovarus was the most common foot and ankle deformity. The best results were obtained by talectomy. The majority of tendo Achillis lengthenings, posteromedial releases, and triple arthrodeses were unsuccessful and were associated with a high complication rate. Congenital convex pes valgus was the second most common deformity. Surgical treatment by open reduction generally resulted in unsuccessful outcomes. Ambulation was achieved in 46 patients. Residual foot deformity was the primary reason for persistent difficulties in walking.
