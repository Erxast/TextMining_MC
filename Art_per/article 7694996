Title : The association of cortical dysplasia and anterior horn arthrogryposis: a case report.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We describe a 21-year-old woman with neurogenic congenital contractures (arthrogryposis) of the lower limbs, normal intelligence, hyper-reflexia and partial epilepsy. MRI revealed bilateral opercular (perisylvian) cortical dysplasia with infolding of cerebral cortex, a focal neuroblast migrational disorder. This type of migrational disorder is known to have a prenatal onset after the 20th fetal week, whereas the anterior horn cell degeneration responsible of neurogenic arthrogryposis originates at 12-14 weeks of gestation. A prenatal viral infection along the neural axis during both these gestational periods or a genetic defect could be responsible for both lesions in this case.
