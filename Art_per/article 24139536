Abstract : Mutations in the fukutin-related protein gene account for a broad spectrum of phenotypes ranging from severe congenital muscular dystrophies to a much milder limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2I. The involvement of the eyes is variable, with most patients having normal eye examination.We describe eye and brain abnormalities in a 16 month-old-boy with Walker-Warburg syndrome phenotype resulting from a novel fukutin-related protein gene mutation in exon 4 and compare these with other reported patients with fukutin-related protein gene mutation.All patients with reported fukutin-related protein gene mutations who had eye involvement were included. Their clinical features, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and eye findings were compared with our patient.Patients with fukutin-related protein gene mutation tend to have no or mild eye involvement (generally strabismus), with very few cases reported of moderate to severe eye involvement. Our patient with a novel mutation c.558dupC(p.Ala187fs) represents one of the most severe phenotypes described in regard to eye involvement.
