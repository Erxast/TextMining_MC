Abstract : <i>YARS2</i> variants have previously been described in patients with myopathy, lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anemia 2 (MLASA2). <i>YARS2</i> encodes the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, which is responsible for conjugating tyrosine to its cognate mt-tRNA for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Here we describe 14 individuals from 11 families presenting with sideroblastic anemia and <i>YARS2</i> variants that we identified using a sideroblastic anemia gene panel or exome sequencing. The phenotype of these patients ranged from MLASA to isolated congenital sideroblastic anemia. As in previous cases, inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability was observed, however, this report includes the first cases with isolated sideroblastic anemia and patients with biallelic <i>YARS2</i> variants that have no clinically ascertainable phenotype. We identified ten novel <i>YARS2</i> variants and three previously reported variants. <i>In vitro</i> amino-acylation assays of five novel missense variants showed that three had less effect on the catalytic activity of YARS2 than the most commonly reported variant, p.(Phe52Leu), associated with MLASA2, which may explain the milder phenotypes in patients with these variants. However, the other two missense variants had a more severe effect on YARS2 catalytic efficiency. Several patients carried the common <i>YARS2</i> c.572 G>T, p.(Gly191Val) variant (minor allele frequency =0.1259) in <i>trans</i> with a rare deleterious <i>YARS2</i> variant. We have previously shown that the p.(Gly191Val) variant reduces YARS2 catalytic activity. Consequently, we suggest that biallelic <i>YARS2</i> variants, including severe loss-of-function alleles in <i>trans</i> of the common p.(Gly191Val) variant, should be considered as a cause of isolated congenital sideroblastic anemia, as well as the MLASA syndromic phenotype.
