Abstract : A 12-year-old Japanese girl who had progressive severe scoliosis but with minimal muscle weakness in the extremities was found to have central core disease. In her muscle biopsies obtained from the biceps brachii and paraspinous muscles, there was type 1 fiber atrophy and predominance, as is commonly seen in congenital myopathies, but the core structure was identified only in the former. To determine whether scoliosis is a prominent feature of this disease, we reviewed 10 patients with central core disease in our laboratory and found 6 ambulant patients who had mild-to-moderate scoliosis. Since kyphoscoliosis becomes prominent as muscle weakness progresses to loss of ambulation in most muscle diseases, this disproportionate spinal involvement in central core disease appears to be a striking feature. All patients with 'idiopathic' scoliosis deserve a careful neurological evaluation, even if they have minimal muscle symptoms in the extremities.
