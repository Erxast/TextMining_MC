Abstract : Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an ultra-rare disease for which there are currently no validated outcome measures for assessing therapeutic intervention efficacy. The aim of this study was to identify a plasma and/or serum microRNA (miRNA) biomarker panel for MNGIE. Sixty-five patients and 65 age and sex matched healthy controls were recruited and assigned to one of four study phases: (i) discovery for sample size determination; (ii) candidate screening; (iii) candidate validation; and (iv) verifying the performance of the validated miRNA panel in four patients treated with erythrocyte-encapsulated thymidine phosphorylase (EE-TP), an enzyme replacement under development for MNGIE. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to profile miRNAs in serum and/or plasma samples collected for the discovery, validation and performance phases, and next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was applied to serum samples assigned to the candidate screening phase. Forty-one differentially expressed candidate miRNAs were identified in the sera of patients (<i>p</i> < 0.05, log<sub>2</sub> fold change > 1). The validation cohort revealed that of those, 27 miRNAs were upregulated in plasma and three miRNAs were upregulated in sera (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Through binary logistic regression analyses, five plasma miRNAs (<i>miR-192-5p</i>, miR-193a-5p, <i>miR-194-5p</i>, <i>miR-215-5p</i> and <i>miR-34a-5p)</i> and three serum miRNAs (<i>miR-192-5p</i>, <i>miR-194-5p</i> and <i>miR-34a-5p</i>) were shown to robustly distinguish MNGIE from healthy controls. Reduced longitudinal miRNA expression of <i>miR-34a-5p</i> was observed in all four patients treated with EE-TP and coincided with biochemical and clinical improvements. We recommend the inclusion of the plasma exploratory miRNA biomarker panel in future clinical trials of investigational therapies for MNGIE; it may have prognostic value for assessing clinical status.
