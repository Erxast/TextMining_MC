Title : Spinal stenosis caused by a Harrington hook in neuromuscular disease. A case report.
Date : 1983
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In a 22-year-old woman with an unspecific congenital myopathy spinal stenosis developed 11 years after a T4-L5 spinal fusion. A slowly progressive lumbosacral lordosis developed, and the Harrington hook at L5 tilted into the canal, eroded the dura, and pressed on the nerve roots. Removal of the hook and fusion of L5-S1 relieved the symptoms.
