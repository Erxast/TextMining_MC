Abstract : Clinico-electroneuromyographic examinations of 108 children with the "flabby child" syndrome of various genesis were carried out. A classification of diseases accompanied with muscular hypotonicity in early childhood is suggested. The electroneuromyographic examinations revealed an increase of the speed of impulse transmission along the peripheral nerves, this transmission being the most pronounced in the first two years of the life, and levelled down by the age of 3 to 7 years.
