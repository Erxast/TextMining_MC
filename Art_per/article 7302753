Abstract : A case of congenital myopathy (fibre type disproportion) in a 14-year-old White girl is described. She was born a 'floppy baby' and her developmental milestones were delayed. A congenital muscle dystrophy was suspected clinically and a quadriceps biopsy examination revealed congenital fibre type disproportion.
