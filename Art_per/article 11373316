Abstract : Cyclin T2a was recently identified as one of the regulatory subunits of the cdk-cyclin complex P-TEFb, the most studied positive factor in the regulation of transcription elongation. By fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), the gene codifying for cyclin T2a has been mapped on human chromosome 2q21. This locus also has been linked to different forms of myopathy. By use of a new specific antiserum raised against cyclin T2a, the immunohistochemical pattern of expression of cyclin T2a in human tissues has been examined and compared to that of cyclin T1, described in the previous report. The observation that immunohistochemical expression of cyclin T2a was high in skeletal muscle cells, whereas it was undetectable in two cases of centronuclear myopathy, together with its chromosomal location, suggests an involvement of the cdk9-cyclin T2a complex in this disease.
