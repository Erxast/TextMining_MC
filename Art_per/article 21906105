Abstract : Bovine arachnomelia is an inherited congenital disorder with malformation mainly of the limbs, the vertebral column and the skull, following a monogenic autosomal recessive heredity. Despite almost identical pathological findings, arachnomelia has previously been mapped to bovine chromosome 23 and 5 in Fleckvieh and Braunvieh respectively. Therefore, this disorder may be an example of locus heterogeneity in cattle. This study aimed to refine the candidate region to allow positional cloning and sequence analyses of candidate genes in Fleckvieh cattle. For that purpose, a case-control association mapping design was set up with a case group of 16 pre-selected affected individuals and a control group of 50 unrelated animals. The subset of affected animals was selected from a total of 129 pathologically confirmed cases due to the occurrence of recombination(s) within a 14.5 cM candidate interval previously mapped to chromosome 23. Six linked microsatellites currently used for indirect gene testing in Fleckvieh were analysed for this purpose. In all selected cases, a genome-wide scan using 44 473 informative SNPs revealed shared segments of homozygosity at 15 adjacent SNPs on chromosome 23. Additional haplotype analysis of 37 carrier bulls confirmed the localization of the arachnomelia locus to a region of 927 kb (13.622-14.549 Mb) containing molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein 1 gene, the most likely candidate gene for arachnomelia in Fleckvieh. The number of recombinant haplotypes observed in cases was more than doubled compared with the number of expected recombinations. This remarkably increased mapping resolution and thus illustrates the benefit of pre-selection in association studies.
