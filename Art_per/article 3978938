Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In a retrospective review of 52 hips in 26 patients with arthrogryposis, 65% of all hips studied were affected by the disorder; 46.6% of the patients were independent ambulators, 33.3% required some type of bracing for ambulation, and 20% were confined to a wheelchair. Based on the results of the authors' treatment as determined by a functional hip score, the authors recommend a one-stage open reduction, varus shortening femoral derotational osteotomy for all unilateral hip dislocations and those bilateral hip dislocations that have a less severe generalized involvement. They also recommend an aggressive traction program with appropriate soft-tissue releases during the neonatal period for patients with subluxation and/or marked limitation of motion of the hip.
