Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Wieacker-Wolff syndrome is a rare congenital syndrome with few reported cases in the current literature. It is traditionally described in males as an X-linked recessive disorder associated with congenital contractures of the feet, progressive neurologic muscular atrophy, and intellectual delay caused by ZC4H2 mutations. The purpose of this paper is to present a female individual with a classic phenotype and cleft palate, a previously undescribed finding in this syndrome. Recent reports have demonstrated that females are rarely severely affected and phenotypic expression is difficult to predict [Zanzottera et al. (); American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A 173A: 1358-1363]. This case supports the unpredictability of Wieacker-Wolff syndrome severity and prompts future questions regarding female mutations and phenotypic expression.
