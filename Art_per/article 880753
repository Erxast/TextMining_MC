Title : Musculoskeletal abnormalities and ichthyosis.
Date : 1977
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Musculoskeletal abnormalities and the associated findings of ichthyosis were seen in three patients between 1972 and 1975. Review of the literature revealed that musculoskeletal abnormalities had previously been recognized in patients with ichthyosis, but not emphasized because of the more frequent and profound neurological abnormalities. Interestingly, our patients had no neurological abnormalities. Ichthyotics should have thorough musculoskeletal as well as neurological and dermatological examinations.
