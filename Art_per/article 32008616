Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Freeman-Sheldon syndrome is a congenital myopathy with a reported prevalence of less than 1 per 1 million. Also known as craniocarpotarsal dysplasia, this syndrome is characterized by muscle contractures and soft-tissue dysplasia of the face, hands, and feet. The resulting musculoskeletal deformities may require multiple orthopedic, ocular, and plastic reconstructive surgeries. The anesthetic challenges include a potentially difficult airway and intravenous access, susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, and an unpredictable response to muscle relaxants. This report of the anesthetic management of 2 children with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome emphasizes the anesthetic considerations for the successful management of patients with this syndrome.
