Abstract : We have generated a new mouse model for congenital myasthenic syndromes by inserting the missense mutation L221F into the ε subunit of the acetylcholine receptor by homologous recombination. This mutation has been identified in man to cause a mild form of slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome with variable penetrance. In our mouse model we observe as in human patients prolonged endplate currents. The summation of endplate potentials may account for a depolarization block at increasing stimulus frequencies, moderate reduced muscle strength and tetanic fade. Calcium and intracellular vesicle accumulation as well as junctional fold loss and organelle degeneration underlying a typical endplate myopathy, were identified. Moreover, a remodeling of neuromuscular junctions occurs in a muscle-dependent pattern expressing variable phenotypic effects. Altogether, this mouse model provides new insight into the pathophysiology of congenital myasthenia and serves as a new tool for deciphering signaling pathways induced by excitotoxicity at peripheral synapses.
