Abstract : Causes of hypotonia in the newborn can be broadly categorized into two classifications. Hypotonia with a supraspinal origin may be seen with systemic disease, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral malformations, syndromes (for example: Down, Prader-Willi, Lowe, Zellweger, Smith-Lemli-Opitz), and c-spine injury. Disorders of the motor unit that present with hypotonia in the newborn period include SMA, congenital myotonic dystrophy, congenital myasthenia gravis, and congenital myopathies. Central core disease is one of the classic congenital myopathies that can be differentiated based on characteristic histologic findings. Muscle fiber samples from patients with central core disease possess distinct morphology that can be diagnostic. Many infants may not exhibit muscle weakness in the newborn period, although there have been rare cases of profound hypotonia and respiratory failure. Clearly, muscle biopsy is the gold standard and is indicated for any infant with marked hypotonia that is not thought to be supraspinal in origin.
