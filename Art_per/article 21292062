Abstract : Gastrointestinal motility disorders are induced by various causes in neonates, some of which are not classified. Generally, these disorders can be classified as a neuropathy or myopathy, each of which can be subdivided into a primary or secondary type. We describe a neonate with a rare form of myopathy related to segmental transposition of the smooth muscle of the ileum and a brief review of the relevant literature.
