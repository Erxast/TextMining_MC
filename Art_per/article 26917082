Abstract : A 14-year-old boy presented with a presumed diagnosis of autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). The neurological examination, nerve conduction study, and brain imaging results were all consistent with the diagnosis. The ophthalmologic examination was notable for a prominent myelinated nerve fiber layer extending from the disk along the major temporal arcades in both eyes. Loss of foveal depression was noted clinically and on spectral domain optical coherence tomography. This case highlights a novel finding that may aid in the diagnosis of ARSACS.
