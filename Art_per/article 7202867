Title : Treatment of extension contracture of the hip in cerebral palsy.
Date : 1981
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Twenty patients with cerebral palsy had a total of 35 extension contractures of the hip, resulting from tightness of the gluteus maximus or hamstring muscles, with associated quadricepts muscle spasticity. Associated deformities included anteriorly dislocated hips, patella alta, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis and calcaneus feet. Active and passive exercises, surgical release of contractures and reduction of anteriorly dislocated hips improved function. Hip flexor or adductor tenotomies must be considered cautiously for patients with spastic hip extensor muscles, because severe extension constricture may develop after either procedure.
