Abstract : The importance of venous structure in the heart is usually overshadowed by that of the arterial system. Coronary sinus (CS) is a part of cardiac venous apparatus and connects left atria to the right atria. Other than having role in physiological contractions of both atria, it contributes substantially to cardiac electrical conduction system. Due to unique placement and connections of the CS, it has become growing interest in clinical cardiology. It is used in cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing, left-sided catheter ablation of arrhythmias, and administration of retrograde cardioplegia in cardiac surgery. In some individuals, CS is presented with anatomical variants. CS diverticulum is a congenital outpouching that provides muscular connection between atria and ventricle. This connection provides a suitable substrate for occurrence of arrhythmias, which even results in life-threatening events such as sudden cardiac death. Early diagnosis leads to treatment with ablation techniques, which ultimately eliminates origins of arrhythmias.
