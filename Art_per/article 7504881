Abstract : Brothers were affected with severe congenital contractures, multiple cutaneous manifestations of ectodermal dysplasia, cleft lip/palate, and psychomotor and growth impairment. High resolution prometaphase chromosomes were normal. Molecular studies of DNA markers, closely flanking the X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia locus, did not show evidence of a submicroscopic deletion from the Xq12-q13 region. The parents and a normal sister exhibited none of these findings. This constellation of anomalies appears to represent a unique AR or XLR syndrome.
