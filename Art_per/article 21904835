Abstract : Disorders in endocrinological pathways rarely lead to manifest acquired or endogenous myopathy so that an interdisciplinary evaluation between neurology and endocrinology is essential for these disorders. Asymptomatic or forme fruste variants may be more common and even underdiagnosed in these circumstances. Dysbalance disorders of protein synthesis, electrolytes and carbohydrates can lead to several rare forms of myopathy due to the dependence on hormonal metabolism. In general, the main neuromuscular symptom is proximal weakness, sometimes in addition to myalgia and muscle atrophy. Endocrine myopathies are usually reversible by treatment of the underlying disease. The severity of the endocrinopathy is of fundamental importance for the long-term clinical outcome.
