Abstract : Nicotiana glauca consumption by pregnant cows or sows produced arthrogryposis and other congenital deformities in their offspring. The plant material administered contained 0.11% anabasine, the suspect teratogen. But concentration varied among various plant parts; woody material was very low but leaves and bark were high. The anabasine was identified by mass spectral fragmentation analysis.
