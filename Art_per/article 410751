Title : Ocular abnormalities in the myopathic hamster (UM-X7.1 strain).
Date : 1977
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Eyes from cardiomyopathic hamsters (UM-X7.1 strain) were examined histologically for evidence of ocular defects. Changes observed included microphthalmia, scleral ectasia, scleral rupture, keratoconus, retinal detachment, retinal dysplasia, retinal fragmentation, retinal thinning, fibrosis of iris and ciliary body, ectopia lentis, and cataract formation. Lesions characteristic of cardiomyopathic hamsters were observed in the myocardium and skeletal muscle. This strain may be a suitable animal model to study the pathogenesis of ocular changes seen in certain congenital connective tissue disorders in man.
