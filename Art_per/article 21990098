Title : Primary and secondary CoQ(10)  deficiencies in humans.
Date : 2011
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : CoQ(10)  deficiencies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. This syndrome has been associated with five major clinical phenotypes: (1) encephalomyopathy, (2) severe infantile multisystemic disease, (3) cerebellar ataxia, (4) isolated myopathy, and (5) nephrotic syndrome. In a few patients, pathogenic mutations have been identified in genes involved in the biosynthesis of CoQ(10)  (primary CoQ(10)  deficiencies) or in genes not directly related to CoQ(10)  biosynthesis (secondary CoQ(10)  deficiencies). Respiratory chain defects, ROS production, and apoptosis variably contribute to the pathogenesis of primary CoQ(10)  deficiencies.
