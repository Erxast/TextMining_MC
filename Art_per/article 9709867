Title : Rapidly progredient scoliosis associated with multicore disease.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Multicore disease is a rare congenital myopathy that normally stops or makes slow progress. It starts with delayed motor development and frequent falls. Especially the proximal muscles are involved. Other symptoms include contractures of joints, clubfoot, high arched palate, chest deformities, involvement of eye-muscle, cardiac abnormalities, hyperlordosis and scoliosis that normally does not require surgery. We report a rare case of advanced scoliosis in multicore disease requiring operative treatment in a 15-year-old girl. In this case the scoliosis took a rapidly progredient course in puberty close to the end of skeletal growth. A dorsal spondylodesis with USS instrumentation from T9 to L3 was performed. A significant reduction of the scoliosis was obtained. Scoliosis in multicore disease may take a rapidly progredient course. Frequent checks will lead to the initiation of surgical treatment in time.
