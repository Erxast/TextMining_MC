Abstract : Congenital arthrogryposis (CA) consists of congenital joint contractures that affect at least two joints in different parts of the body. Approximately, 80% of CA cases are neurogenic, with changes to the formation, structure or functioning of the central and/or peripheral nervous systems. Most abnormalities are triggered either by motoneurons decreased activation in the corticospinal tract or by direct motoneurons injury. There had been few reports in the literature correlating congenital infection in humans with arthrogryposis until 2015. CA has recently been described associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS).The objective of this study was to investigate and describe accurately the arthrogrypotic alterations in infants diagnosed with CZS and thus, suggest a possible pattern of orthopedic impairment. A total of 198 medical records of infants with CZS were evaluated. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 infants were included in the present study. Arthrogrypotic joints were orthopedically evaluated in four segments: right, left, upper, and lower limbs. All the four segments were assessed independently.Flexed wrists were the most frequently observed manifestation, associated with ulnar deviation (35.29%). Deformities were also commonly found in the third and fourth fingers (64.70%). Hip dislocation was found in 58.82% of the patients and talipes equinovarus and equinovalgus ankles were found in 29.41 and 23.52%.There was a particular pattern of joint impairment related to CZS and arthogrypotic alterations of infants evaluated in this study.
