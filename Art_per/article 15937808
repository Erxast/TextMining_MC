Date : 2005
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two patients with hemangioendothelioma and elevated plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are presented. A reduction in the plasma VEGF level after therapeutic intervention correlated with a successful clinical response. Conversely, a stable plasma VEGF level correlated with therapeutic failure.
