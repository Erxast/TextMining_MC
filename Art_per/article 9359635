Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder characterized by a great variability in its clinical manifestations. The mutational basis underlying DM consists of an unstable (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat in the 3' untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene (DMPK). Conflicting results on DMPK gene expression in congenitally affected infants (CDM) have been published. Moreover, the prominence of satellite cells seen in muscle of CDM infants supports the notion that the congenital form is associated with an arrest in muscle development and suggests a role for the DMPK gene during differentiation and maturation of muscle. In order to clarify these findings, a comparative study of DMPK and myogenic factor mRNA levels was performed in developing mouse muscle tissues and cultured muscle cells at different developmental stages. Results show that DMPK gene expression is upregulated at a late stage of muscular development. This upregulation does not seem to depend on a given muscle specific bHLH factor.
