Abstract : Congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A), also termed merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), is a severe form of CMD caused by mutations in the laminin Î±2 gene (LAMA2). Of the more than 300 likely pathogenic variants found in the Leiden Open Variant Database, the majority are truncating mutations leading to complete LAMA2 loss of function, but multiple copy number variants (CNVs) have also been reported with variable frequency.We collected a cohort of individuals diagnosed with likely MDC1A and sought to identify both single nucleotide variants and small and larger CNVs via exome sequencing by extending the analysis of sequencing data to detect splicing changes and CNVs.Standard exome analysis identified multiple novel LAMA2 variants in our cohort, but only four cases carried biallelic variants. Since likely truncating LAMA2 variants are often found in heterozygosity without a second allele, we performed additional splicing and CNV analysis on exome data and identified one splice change outside of the canonical sequences and three CNVs, in the remaining four cases.Our findings support the expectation that a portion of MDC1A cases may be caused by at least one CNV allele and show how these changes can be effectively identified by additional analysis of existing exome data.
