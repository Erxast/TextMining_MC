Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This article discusses hemifacial microsomia and Treacher Collins syndrome relative to the nature of these congenital deformities as well as the clinical, radiographic, and diagnostic characteristics. These patients often have severe facial deformities with hypoplasia or aplasia of the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) and mandible. The surgical treatment options are presented, including the advantages and disadvantages of autogenous tissues versus patient-fitted total joint prostheses to reconstruct the TMJs and mandible as well as counterclockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex.
