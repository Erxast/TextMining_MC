Title : Carey-Fineman-Ziter Syndrome: A MYMK-Related Myopathy Mimicking Brainstem Dysgenesis.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Carey-Fineman-Ziter syndrome is a congenital myopathy associated with mutations in the MYMK gene. It is clinically defined by the combination of hypotonia, Moebius-Robin sequence, facial anomalies and motor delay. Historically it was considered a brainstem dysgenesis syndrome. We provide detailed information of a Spanish boy with compound heterozygous variants in MYMK gene. A muscle biopsy performed as a toddler only disclosed minimal changes, but muscle MRI showed severe fatty infiltration of gluteus muscles and to a lesser extent in adductors magnus, sartorius and soleus muscles. Clinical course is fairly static, but the identification of new well characterized genetic cases will help to delineate the complete phenotype.
