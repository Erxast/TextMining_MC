Abstract : Homocystinuria is a congenital metabolic disorder in which cystathionine β-synthase deficiency results in a prominent increase in homocysteine (serum levels > 100 μM), causing mental retardation, atherosclerotic cerebral infarction, and osteoporosis accompanied by fragility fractures. Encountering a case with excessive homocysteinemia such as that seen in hereditary homocystinuria is unlikely during usual medical examinations. However, in individuals who have vitamin B or folate deficiency, serum homocysteine concentrations are known to increase. These individuals may also have a polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, MTHFR (C677T: TT type), which regulates homocysteine metabolism. These changes in homocysteine levels may elicit symptoms resembling those of homocystinuria (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis).High serum homocysteine has been shown to have detrimental effects on neural cells, vascular endothelial cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Homocysteine is also known to increase oxidative stress, disrupt cross-linking of collagen molecules, and increase levels of advanced glycation end products, which results in reduced bone strength through a mechanism that goes beyond low bone density and increased bone resorption. Therefore, high serum homocysteine may be regarded as a factor that can reduce both bone mass and impair bone quality. In this review, we outline the epidemiology and pathophysiology of osteoporosis associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.
