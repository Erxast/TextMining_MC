Date : 1986
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A rare case of true congenital ankylosis of the mandible to the maxilla, noticed at birth without any associated deformity, is presented. The child was initially kept alive by nasogastric tube feeding and proper oral feeding was established later by bilateral coronoidectomy to release the ankylosis. The pathogenesis of congenital ankylosis is also discussed.
