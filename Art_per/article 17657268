Abstract : To evaluate the effect of severe rigid kyphotic scoliosis treated with posterior spinal osteotomyA total of 11 cases(average 11.2 years) of severe rigid kyphotic scoliosis treated with posterior spinal osteotomy from Mar. 2005 to Sept. 2006 were retrospective. Of those cases, 3 were of neurofibromatosis, 5 of congenital scoliosis, 1 of poliomyelitis and 2 of idiopathic scoliosis. The flexibility of all patients was less than 25%. They had an average follow-up period of 1.3 years (0.5-2 years).There were 3 cases of one segment posterior wedge osteotomy, 2 of two segment posterior wedge osteotomy and 2 of three segment wedge osteotomy. Transpedicular osteotomy was performed in 2 cases, and the last 2 cases encountered vertebral resection and posterior column removed. The average kyphotic angle was 108 degrees (ranging from 87 to 135 degrees) and the average scoliosis angle was 97 degrees (ranging from 65 to 135 degrees) before operation. After operation the average kyphotic angle was corrected to 49 degrees (the correction rate was 55%) and the average scoliosis angle was corrected to 37 degrees(the correction rate was 66%) . The height rose up by an average of 4.7 cm. No neurological complication happened in all the 11 cases.It is an effective method that severe rigid kyphotic spinal scoliosis is treated with posterior osteotomy.
