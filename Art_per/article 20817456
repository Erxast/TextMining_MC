Abstract : Dynamin 2 gene (DNM2) mutations result in an autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and a Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy. DNM2-CMT but not DNM2-CNM patients were noted to have neutropenia. We here report a man with paravertebral muscles hypertrophy and mild neutropenia. His muscle biopsy was typical for CNM with additional "necklace" fibers. Sequencing of DNM2 revealed a known heterozygous c.1269C>T (p.Arg369Trp) mutation. Necklace fibers were considered as a pathological hallmark of late onset X-linked CNM due to mutations in MTM1 but have not been observed in DNM2-CNM. The findings broaden the features of DNM2-myopathy.
