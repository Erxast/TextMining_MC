Abstract : Dystonia due to spinal lesions in adult patients is characterized by the provocation and/or amelioration of the spasm by somatosensory stimulation with a sensory trick.An infant with brachytelephalangic chondrodysplasia punctata developed flaccid tetraplegia due to cervical cord compression resulting from congenital atlantoaxial dislocation. Episodic, tonic extension of the extremities, neck, and trunk had appeared daily since age two years and was often provoked by tactile stimulation. Although decompression surgery was performed at age three years, progressive spinal deformity resulted in the aggravation of episodic dystonia thereafter, lasting for hours. Foot dorsiflexion and wearing a truncal brace for scoliosis inhibited these spasms. Intrathecal baclofen bolus injection transiently ameliorated the paroxysmal dystonia and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in the lower urinary tract.Paroxysmal dystonia is unusual in children with spinal cord lesions; however, it should be recognized for appropriate individualized clinical management.
