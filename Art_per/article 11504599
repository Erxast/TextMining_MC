Abstract : To determine the incidence of selective type 1 fiber atrophy (hypotrophy) and its possible significance in various muscle diseases of childhood, we reviewed 2212 muscle biopsies from children which we had examined in the past 20 years histochemically with ATPase staining. Type 1 fiber atrophy was seen in a variety of neuromuscular disorders, but predominantly in congenital myopathies, including all patients with congenital fiber type disproportion myopathy (20 patients), central core disease (12 patients) and multicore disease (four patients). Although type 1 fiber atrophy was not a constant feature in nemaline myopathy and myotubular myopathy, all patients with these diseases had abnormal fiber type distribution which included type 1 fiber predominance both with and without type 2B fiber deficiency. Together with abnormal fiber type distribution, type 1 fiber atrophy was a common finding in childhood neuromuscular disorders, especially congenital myopathies.
