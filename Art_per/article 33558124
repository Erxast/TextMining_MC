Abstract : Pathogenic variants in TPM2 have been associated with a variable clinical spectrum, including congenital myopathies and distal arthrogryposis, all but one with dominant inheritance. We report the second case of recessively inherited TPM2-related Escobar variant of multiple pterygium syndrome and congenital myopathy in a patient from a consanguineous family. Ultra-structural examination of the biopsy revealed few cores/mini-cores and sparse nemaline rods. We found a novel homozygous intronic sequence variant, c.564-2A>C in TPM2. This variant is predicted to abolish the consensus acceptor splice site for exon 6b of TPM2 gene. Parents of the proband, both healthy adults with no clinical features, were heterozygous for the variant. Here we establish a homozygous intronic variant in TPM2 as the likely cause of Escobar variant of multiple pterygium syndrome and congenital myopathy, with sparse nemaline rods.
