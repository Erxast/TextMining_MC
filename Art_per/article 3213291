Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A report is given on a premature stillborn with severe congenital spinal muscular atrophy, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and hydrops fetalis. During delivery the head was spontaneously pulled off. The neuromuscular disease was the cause of this unusual complication. No alterations of collagenous fibres were found by light and electron microscopy in dermis, aorta or in the Achilles tendon. The hydrops fetalis was not of immunological nature.
