Abstract : Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are a highly heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders. A subgroup displays a specific deficiency in a protein of the extracellular matrix, the alpha2 chain of laminin-2 (merosin). A number of mutations in the gene encoding this protein have been identified in patients who present with a severe phenotype and white matter changes.
