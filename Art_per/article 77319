Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two cases of central core disease, father and daughter, of a family with dominant autosomal inheritance, are presented, one with bilateral congenital dislocation of the hip. Muscle biopsy was performed in both cases. Oxidative enzymes evidenced only type I fibers, most of them presenting a central core and not uncommonly more than one. On electron microscopy the cores generally appeared well demarcated from the surrounding fibrils and were characterized by lack of mitochondria and abnormalities of the Z line. Transitional aspects from normal fibers to completely unstructured cores were observed, as well as from well structured and unstructured cores. These findings are discussed in the light of the previous literature and particular attention is paid to the problem of differentiation between central core and multicore disease. The pathogenesis of the muscular alteration is also discussed in relation with the possibility of their neurogenic origin. Eventually, the histochemical and ultrastructural similarities between central cores and target fibers are focused.
