Abstract : In our experience, previous flaps designed for correction of the skin deficiency in complex clasped thumb do not sufficiently address the palmar contracture of the deformity. Moreover, the index finger flap, previously described by Ezaki and Oishi, provides insufficient skin at its apex with the possibility of incomplete correction and the frequent need of a thenar release incision. This article describes a flap designed for widening of the narrow thumb-index web space and release of the palmar thumb contracture in cases of congenital clasped thumb. This flap provides sufficient correction of the palmar contracture and at the same time provides adequate width and depth of the thumb-index web space.
