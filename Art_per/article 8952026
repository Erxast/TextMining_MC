Abstract : Pathogenesis of Aino virus (AIV), a suspected causative agent of congenital abnormalities of calves, has not yet been established by experimental infection of dams. To investigate the pathogenesis, 10(3) median tissue culture infective doses per 0.2 ml of AIV strain JaNAr 28 was inoculated into the yolk sac of 8-day-old chick embryos. At 4, 7, 10, and 13 days post-inoculation (PI) 20 eggs were opened and macro- and microscopic studies combined with virus recovery and immunohistochemical detection of the virus antigen were performed. At 7 to 13 days PI chick embryos manifested marked hydranencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, arthrogryposis, and scoliosis, with the highest incidences of 86.7%, 73.3%, 80.0%, and 20.0%, respectively. At 4 days PI the viral antigen was found in nerve cells, gitter cells in mild necrotic foci of the central nervous system (CNS), degenerative myotubules, and macrophages in the interstitium, which was associated with the early phase of AIV-induced encephalitis and polymyositis, with occasional accompanying hemorrhage and clumping of myotubular fragments. From 7 to 10 days PI, AIV antigen increased markedly in the liquefactive necrosis and in both degenerative and normal-looking myotubules in conjunction with developing hydranencephaly and arthrogryposis. The encephalitis and myositis had a tendency to mitigate by 10 days PI, coincident with a slight decrease in amount of AIV antigen. At 13 days PI there was almost no detectable AIV antigen in CNS and skeletal muscles, probably due to depletion of cells having affinity to AIV.
