Abstract : Acquired jejuno-ileal diverticulosis are rare (0.1 to 1.4%) but their complications are non exceptional (6 to 13%) with a death rate which can reach 40% in older patients. From a histological view, acquired diverticulosis differ from congenital ones by an absent muscular tunic. Complications consist in, by descending order: diverticulitis, perforation (7%), acute bowel obstruction (3%), intestinal hemorrhage (2.7%) mostly massive, malabsorption of fat, protein, macrocytic anaemia, intestinal tumors same as found in small, bowel. The treatment of small bowel diverticulosis becomes surgical only when complicated. It consists in the strict resection of the complicated diverticulosis area, respecting the asymptomatic diverticulosis. Prophylaxis of the complications is based on healthy diet habits against stasis, bowel pressure using antispasmodics, intestinal disinfectants, residue free diet, and against infection (oral tetracyclines).
