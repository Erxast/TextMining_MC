Abstract : The King-Denborough syndrome (KDS) is a congenital myopathy with musculoskeletal abnormalities, and definitely associated with susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH). We present the first report in Japan concerning the management of a KDS patient. A 2-year-old boy was scheduled for cryptorchidopexy. He had some physical signs of KDS, e.g. pectus excavatum, low-set ears, malar hypoplasia, micrognathia, ptosis and down-slanting palpebral fissures. Moreover, his mother and maternal grand-uncle had medical history of MH. Therefore, he was diagnosed as KDS by pediatricians. All of the preoperative examinations, including serum creatine phosphokinase level, are normal. Previous 15 case-reports suggest that in KDS patients MH might be triggered by volatile anesthetics. To avoid the trigger, we maintained the general anesthesia with propofol, fentanyl and vecuronium. During perioperative period, his body temperature was 36.3-38.1 degrees C, and no symptom of MH was observed. It is rare that a diagnosis of KDS is made preoperatively since the MH-induction is involved in the criteria of this syndrome. In the anesthesia of patients who are suspected of KDS from their characteristic features or familial histories, an anesthesiologist should pay attention to prevent MH. The total intravenous anesthesia method appears useful for the management of KDS.
