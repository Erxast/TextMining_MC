Title : Rapsyn mutations in hereditary myasthenia: distinct early- and late-onset phenotypes.
Date : 2003
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Rapsyn mutations in 16 unrelated patients with a congenital/hereditary myasthenic syndrome were identified, and a mutation (N88K) common to each of them was found. Two distinct phenotypes were noted: early and late onset. The former is frequently associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and life-threatening crises. The late-onset phenotype developed in adolescence or adulthood and was initially mistaken for seronegative myasthenia gravis. Recognition of this late-onset phenotype should prevent inappropriate immunotherapy.
