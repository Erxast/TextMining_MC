Title : Cerebral ventricular dilation in congenital myotonic dystrophy.
Date : 1987
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Ultrasonography or computed tomography scanning of the brain was performed in 10 infants with congenital myotonic dystrophy between the age of 1 day and 2 months, and showed intracranial abnormalities in all. Ventricular dilation was diagnosed in eight (80%), subarachnoid hemorrhage in one, and white matter infarcts in one. The common finding of ventricular dilation is probably related to developmental brain abnormality dating back to fetal life, because it was already present in three infants scanned on the first day of life. Neonatal asphyxia was present in seven infants, associated with intraventricular hemorrhage in two. The relationship between these changes and mental retardation, which is a common feature in this disease, is unclear.
