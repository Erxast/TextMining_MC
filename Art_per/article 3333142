Title : Arterial involvement in genetic diseases.
Date : 1987
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Whereas the information on the subject of arterial status is sketchy and haphazard with respect to any one genetic disorder, the number of these diseases would have precluded the provision of a critical review within the scope of this presentation. Thus, it was deemed more meaningful to approach the subject selectively. A brief summary was provided on the nature of the arterial wall and its involvement in genetic diseases either as a primary target or a secondarily affected organ, and on "affinity" of various genetic disorders for a type (elastic, muscular, or smallest), segment (proximal, distal), and layer (intimal, medial, adventitial) of the arterial tree or the arterial wall, respectively. Genetic diseases may affect arteries by "causing" (a) congenital malformations, (b) alteration of the arterial "makeup" without necessarily producing definable lesions, and (c) modification of a nongenetic arterial disease (e.g., atherosclerosis), or by "producing" (d) arterial lesions that are characteristic of (even specific for?) a given genetic disorder. A few examples were selected to illustrate (b) (tuberous sclerosis; infantile GM1-gangliosidosis), (c) Wolman's disease; familial hyperlipoproteinemias), and (d) [Hurler's disease, neurofibromatosis; Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IV)]. Whenever available, the results of electron microscopic studies carried out in our laboratories were included. Some of these have not been reported in the literature to date. The need for a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to the study of genetic diseases in general is stressed in closing.
