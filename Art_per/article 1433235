Title : Lethal olivopontoneocerebellar hypoplasia with dysmorphic features in sibs.
Date : 1992
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This report describes the clinical and neuropathological features in male and female sibs who died shortly after birth as a result of frequent convulsions and lack of spontaneous respiratory effect. Both sibs had a prominent occiput with mild contractures and the female also had overlapping fingers and rockerbottom feet. The genetic and neuropathological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of an autosomal recessive form of olivopontoneocerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy.
