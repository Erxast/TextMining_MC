Title : Electromyography in congenital nemaline myopathy.
Date : 1989
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : To clarify the discrepancies between earlier reports of electromyography (EMG) in congenital nemaline myopathy (CNM), conventional electromyography was done on 13 patients with CNM, and results were compared with those of 18 earlier EMG examinations of the same patients. Fiber density was measured in 10 patients with a computerized method and neuromuscular jitter in 3 with single-fiber EMG. With age, the EMG abnormality progressed, and "neuropathic" EMG features developed in distal muscles. In 9 of 10 patients fiber density was higher than normal. In two of three patients jitter was abnormal. Motor (13 of 13 patients) and sensory (3 of 3 patients) nerve conduction velocities were normal. Our results seem to explain the conflicting reports of EMG in CNM. We conclude that active degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibers takes place in CNM and suggest that the "neuropathic" motor unit potentials seen in our patients may be secondary to myopathic disease activity.
