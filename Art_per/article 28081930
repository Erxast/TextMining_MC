Abstract : This study describes the management of foot deformity in children. Severe congenital clubfeet treated using posteromedial release without talocalcaneal joint release were flexible and functional. Talectomy may be necessary for congenital clubfeet with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. The diagnosis and severity of vertical talus were defined based on stress radiographs. For the deformity with spina bifida, a combination of talocalcaneal joint fusion and precise correction by soft tissue release and tendon transfer was performed. This combined surgery is effective, particularly in patients with equino-varus feet.
