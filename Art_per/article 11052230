Date : 2000
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Olmsted syndrome is a rare keratinization disorder; 18 cases have been published so far. It associates a mutilating cogenital palmoplantar keratoderma with periorificial erythematokeratotic lesions. We report herein two new unrelated male children with Olmsted syndrome (OS), one of whom was studied by light and electron microscopy. Our histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings suggest that this disease is related to epidermal hyperproliferation. We present herein a review of the twenty cases published so far and discuss the major clinicopathological and genetic features of this disease.
