Title : PRUNE1 Deficiency: Expanding the Clinical and Genetic Spectrum.

Abstract : Primary microcephaly and profound global developmental delay have been considered the core clinical phenotype in patients with bi-allelic <i>PRUNE1</i> mutations.Linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a multiplex family and extraction of further cases from a WES repository containing 571 children with severe developmental disabilities and neurologic symptoms.We identified bi-allelic <i>PRUNE1</i> mutations in twelve children from six unrelated families. All patients who survived beyond the first 6 months of life had early-onset global developmental delay, bilateral spastic paresis, dysphagia and difficult-to-treat seizures, while congenital or later-evolving microcephaly was not a consistent finding. Brain MRI showed variable anomalies with progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophies and T2-hyperintense brain stem lesions. Peripheral neuropathy was documented in five cases. Disease course was progressive in all patients and eight children died in the first or early second decade of life. In addition to the previously reported missense mutation p.(Asp106Asn), we observed a novel homozygous missense variant p.(Leu172Pro) and a homozygous contiguous gene deletion encompassing most of the <i>PRUNE1</i> gene and part of the neighboring <i>BNIPL</i> gene.<i>PRUNE1</i> deficiency causes severe early-onset disease affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. Microcephaly is probably not a universal feature.
