Date : 1980
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A review on the orthopedic and trauma aspects of the muscular dystrophies and the non-progressive myopathies is given on the basis of personal experience and the relevant literature. Pathomechanism, incidence, treatment modalities of spinal deformities, joint malformations, contractures and systemic bone abnormalities are reviewed too. Spontaneous tendon ruptures are thought to be the complications of non-progressive myopathies.
