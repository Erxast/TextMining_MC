Abstract : Adductor tightness is a typical symptom in CDH. In cases of subluxation and complete dislocation even a rigid abduction contracture can occur, preventing reduction and favouring redislocation. The contracture of the hip joint is the result of neurophysiological disorders, which can be treated by an exercise program on a neurophysiological basis. 62 children with 73 severely contracted and 5 hypotonic hip dislocations have been treated by the so-called "Vojta-program" before reduction. In a prospective study over 5 years this kind of treatment has been very successful: the incidence of necrosis of the femoral head could be reduced to 4%, long-lasting traction was not necessary anymore and the rigid hip joints required open reduction only in 2 cases.
