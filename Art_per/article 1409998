Title : Neonatal Volkmann's ischemic contracture of the forearm: a report of five cases.
Date : 1992
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report five cases of children born with forearm wounds associated with motor and sensory losses to the hand and forearm. Their evolution toward muscle retraction is very similar to the classic description of Volkmann's ischemic contracture. These cases should not be confused with upper extremity gangrene of the newborn or aplasia cutis congenita. Two cases of neonatal Volkmann's ischemia have already been reported in the literature and identified as such. Another very similar case has been reported as upper extremity gangrene of the newborn, and three more cases of a forearm wound with neuromuscular involvement have been reported as aplasia cutis congenita. We believe that neonatal Volkmann's ischemic contracture of the forearm should be recognized as a separate entity. Its early diagnosis may improve treatment, especially for children with recent injury, in whom intracompartmental pressures may still be elevated. Early hand therapy and splinting are mandatory to minimize late sequelae.
