Abstract : Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is a rare and life-threatening disease characterized by an enzymatic defect in the fatty acid Î²-oxidation pathway. A nulliparous woman with VLCADD showed improvements in serum levels of the long-chain acylcarnitine moiety (C14:1) during pregnancy and successfully delivered a healthy infant vaginally. Pregnancy and vaginal delivery can be successfully completed in patients with VLCADD with careful management.
