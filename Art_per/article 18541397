Title : Paternally inherited case of congenital DM1: brain MRI and review of literature.
Date : 2009
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The congenital form of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (CDM1) has an almost exclusively maternal transmission and is characterized by mental retardation and by moderate/severe ventriculomegaly and white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report a 20-year-old case of CDM1 with paternal inheritance showing mental retardation and normal brain MRI, and presenting at birth with hypotonia, facial weakness and feeding difficulties. We reviewed the literature for studies addressing the brain neuroimaging in paternally transmitted CDM1 and found four studies reporting diffuse cerebral, frontal lobe or mild parietal cortical atrophy, or mild ventricular dilatation, without white matter abnormalities. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing normal brain MRI in a mentally retarded CDM1 patient with paternal transmission.
