Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP, MIM 135100) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by postnatal progressive heterotopic ossification of the connective tissue and congenital malformation of the big toes. Recently, FOP has been associated with a specific mutation of ACVR1, the gene coding for a bone morphogenetic protein type I receptor. We report the case of a Moroccan patient with FOP carrying a rarely occurring mutation of ACVR1 gene.
