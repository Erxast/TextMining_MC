Abstract : A baby-girl with congenital deafness was admitted at the age of 8 weeks for lack of head control, truncal hypotonia and echodense kidneys. At the age of 10 weeks cranial MRI showed a normal brain structure, generalized mild hypomyelination but no lactate peak on (1)H MR spectroscopy. A combined defect of respiratory chain enzyme complexes I, III, IV and V and severe depletion of mitochondrial DNA was found in skeletal muscle tissue. Genetic analysis revealed a novel mutation c.368T>C (p.Phe123Ser) in the RRM2B gene in the expressed maternal allele. The paternal allele was present in genomic DNA, but was not expressed as mature mRNA.
