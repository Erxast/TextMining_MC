Title : Tubular aggregate myopathy with abnormal pupils and skeletal deformities.
Date : 2002
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A patient is described with a novel syndrome characterised by progressive muscular weakness, contractures, pupillary muscle dysfunction, and skeletal deformity. The main myopathological feature was an abundance of tubular aggregates in both type I and type II muscle fibres. Myopathies in which tubular aggregates are the defining feature are rare and either present with progressive muscle weakness or exercise induced myalgia. Tubular aggregate myopathy with symptomatic smooth muscle dysfunction and skeletal deformities has not been described before.
