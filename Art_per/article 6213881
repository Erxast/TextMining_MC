Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A girl with congenital limb weakness, mental retardation, and corneal ulceration died with respiratory insufficiency at age 4 years. Histochemistry of muscle biopsy showed only nonspecific myopathy, but electronmicroscopy revealed subsarcolemmal and intramyofibrillar accumulation of glycogen. Biochemical studies showed increased glycogen content of muscle with lack of phosphofructokinase. Phosphorylase b kinase activity was about 30% of normal. The relationship of the double enzyme deficiency to this unusual clinical picture is unclear.
