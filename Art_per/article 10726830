Abstract : McArdle's disease (glycogenosis type V) is an inherited glycogen storage disease characterized clinically by myalgia, cramps and sometimes myoglobinuria, triggered by exercise. The onset of exercise intolerance is usually in late childhood or adolescence and diagnosis is exceptionally established during infancy. We report the case of a 6-year-old girl who had been complaining of aching muscles for a long time, and who presented after a near-drowning incident, with extensive muscle necrosis, probably secondary to myophosphorylase deficiency-induced cramps. These unusual manifestations led to the diagnosis of this rare disorder. We compare the clinical findings of this case to nine previous reports. This highlights the heterogeneous spectrum of this disease in childhood and supports the distinction of three clinical pictures in childhood: a neonatal form rapidly fatal, a milder form with congenital myopathic symptoms and a benign classical form with myalgia, cramps and pigmenturia.
