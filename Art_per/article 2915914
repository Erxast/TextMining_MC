Abstract : Muscle contractures are infrequent in Israel. This report discusses one case of a congenital contracture associated with a skin dimple treated in Israel. A 3-year-old boy presented with difficulty in running, riding a bicycle, and squatting. Flexion of the right hip in adduction was impossible. The hip could be fully flexed in abduction. Congenital contracture of the right gluteus maximus muscle was successfully treated by surgical release.
