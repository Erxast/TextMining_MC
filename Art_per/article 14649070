Abstract : Pain affecting the elbow joint may be caused by a number of different pathologies. In principle, these can be grouped by causality criteria into degenerative causes, inflammatory causes, tumor disease, congenital disease and the sequelae of trauma. The majority of these latter are associated with typical clinical symptoms that can be established with the aid of a systematic clinical examination, history-taking, inspection, palpation, an examination of joint mobility, and finally radiography. In this way, the diagnosis can rapidly be established.
