Abstract : Microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma (MAC) are a group of congenital eye anomalies that can affect one or both eyes. Patients can present one or a combination of these ocular abnormalities in the so called "MAC spectrum". The <i>KIF17</i> gene encodes the kinesin-like protein Kif17, a microtubule-based, ATP-dependent, motor protein that is pivotal for outer segment development and disc morphogenesis in different animal models, including mice and zebrafish. In this report, we describe a Sicilian family with two siblings affected with congenital coloboma, microphthalmia, and a mild delay of motor developmental milestones. Genomic DNA from the siblings and their unaffected parents was sequenced with a clinical exome that revealed compound heterozygous variants in the <i>KIF17</i> gene (NM_020816.4: c.1255C > T (p.Arg419Trp); c.2554C > T (p.Arg852Cys)) segregating with the MAC spectrum phenotype of the two affected siblings. Variants were inherited from the healthy mother and father, are present at a very low-frequency in genomic population databases, and are predicted to be deleterious in silico. Our report indicates the potential co-segregation of these biallelic <i>KIF17</i> variants with microphthalmia and coloboma, highlighting a potential conserved role of this gene in eye development across different species.
