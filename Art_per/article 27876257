Abstract : STIM1 is a reticular Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor composed of a luminal and a cytosolic domain. Missense mutations in the luminal domain have been associated with tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM), while cytosolic mutations can cause Stormorken syndrome, a multisystemic disease associating TAM with asplenia, thrombocytopenia, miosis, ichthyosis, short stature and dyslexia. Here we present the case of a 41-year-old female complaining of exercise intolerance. Clinical examination showed short stature, scoliosis, proximal muscle weakness with lower limb predominance, and ophthalmoplegia. Laboratory tests revealed hypocalcemia, mild anemia and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Whole-body muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed asplenia. Muscle biopsy was consistent with TAM. STIM1 gene analysis disclosed the novel c.252T>A, p.D84E missense mutation which was shown to induce constitutive STIM1 clustering in a functional study. This study reports a novel STIM1 mutation located in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF domain causing TAM with features of Stormorken syndrome.
