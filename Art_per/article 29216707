Abstract : The concept of arthrogryposis encompasses several conditions that share the presence of multiple congenital contractures. The knee is frequently involved and is an important cause of morbidity in these patients. Flexion contractures of the knee are the most common ones and have a worse prognosis than extension contractures. Different approaches are available to treat flexion contractures of the knee. Distal femoral extension osteotomy effectively corrects fixed flexion, but may lead to residual deformity. This iatrogenic deformity disrupts the anterior convexity of the femoral shaft and leads to serious problems in the subsequent management of orthopedic conditions. This is a case report of a patient with arthrogryposis and a femur deformity who sustained a supracondylar fracture. Managing the fracture was challenging due to a disruption in the normal architecture of the femur. This is a description of the osteosynthesis approach used to treat the fracture and the patients pre-existing deformity.
