Title : Anaesthesia in myotubular (centronuclear) myopathy.
Date : 2000
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A patient with a known history of myotubular myopathy presented for surgery for insertion of a tibial nail. Anasthesia was induced and maintained using an intravenous anasthetic technique. Neuromuscular function was assessed using mechanomyography, which showed a profound reduction in muscle contractility. In view of this, the use of muscle relaxants was avoided altogether. Nerve conduction was normal but electromyography showed small motor units, with generalised distribution, suggesting mild to moderately severe myopathy. The patient made a slow but uneventful recovery.
