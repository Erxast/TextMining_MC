Abstract : The investigators report the case of a 6-week-old girl with a cap-like congenital myopathy and frequent coughing during feeding. Neonatal swallowing assessments were performed with surface electromyography of the submental muscle group and nasal airflow during sucking and swallowing. A videofluoroscopic swallow study was performed separately. The registration of swallowing and breathing revealed a highly coordinated sequence of sucking, swallowing, and breathing. However, after a series of sucking and swallowing there was residue in the hypopharyngeal area, causing laryngeal penetration and coughing. Based on the findings, specific recommendations such as the use of a soft nipple, diminished suck-swallow sequences, and limited feeding time were made for this girl. These proved to be appropriate to prevent coughing as a signal of penetration or aspiration of milk during swallowing. This case highlights the profit of neonatal swallowing assessment, which can provide recommendations for safe oral feeding.
