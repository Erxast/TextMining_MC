Abstract : Skin lesions seen after delivery are frequent and mostly shallow, without the need for special care or diagnosis challenge. In the following case, an infant was born at 35 weeks gestation, presented after the delivery with a well-demarcated, necrotic plaque over the right forearm with neurologic deficit. The differential diagnosis includes life-threatening reasons, therefore, emergent laboratory and imaging tests were held. Treatment was given after consulting a multidisciplinary team of experts, including antibiotic treatment, blood products and anticoagulation and physiotherapy treatment was started. Under this treatment, improvement was noticed but there was still a motor restriction. He was discharged home on his 24th day of life, with the working diagnosis of Congenital Volkmann Ischemic Contracture (CVIC). On his seventh week of life, he arrived to the emergency room with focal seizure resulting from an infarct seen on an MRI. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of five months. In conclusion, Congenital Volkmann Ischemic Contracture is a rare diagnosis, however, awareness is of importance since fast treatment is crucial for future prognosis.
