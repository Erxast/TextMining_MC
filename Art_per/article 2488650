Abstract : An epizootic of abortions, weak lambs, stillbirths, and congenital arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly occurred in a sheep flock in West Texas. The outbreak began during the first week of January 1987 and continued through the third week of February 1987. Lambs born after February 1987 were not affected. A high incidence of antibodies to Cache Valley virus (Texas 7856 isolate) was demonstrated in the ewes' serum and in precolostral serum from affected lambs. No virus was isolated from tissues and body fluids of the affected lambs. The clinical, pathological, and immunological features of the epizootic were similar to those reported in Akabane virus infection in sheep. Although serological findings strongly suggest Cache Valley virus as the etiological agent of this outbreak, transmission studies are needed.
