Abstract : In a premature male infant born of consanguineous parents, restrictive dermopathy was diagnosed. This is a rarely described, lethal, congenital skin disease. The diagnosis was based on the clinical and histopathological findings: a fixed facial expression (so-called 'porcelain face') with palpebral fissures inclined laterally downwards, microstomia with the mouth in the 'O'-position, micrognathia and low-set ears inclined toward the rear, prominent blood vessels in the skin and contracture of all the joints; histopathological examination of a skin biopsy revealed a smooth epidermis and a relatively thin dermis with an abnormal structure of the dermal connective tissue in which the collagen fibres were arranged more or less horizontally, parallel to the epidermis, and the number of elastin fibres was sharply decreased. Various adnexal structures were present but the hair follicles had an abortive appearance. Thanks in part to the finding of a homozygous mutation in the so-called ZMPSTE24-gene, it could be concluded that restrictive dermopathy is probably an autosomal recessive laminopathy, related to progeria. Increasing the clinical awareness of this disease may contribute to reducing the presumed under-reporting, so that future research will become possible.
