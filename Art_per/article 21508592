Abstract : Congenital generalized lipodystrophy of Berardinelli-Seip type is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by nearly complete absence of adipose tissue and a consequent generalized muscular appearance, which is recognized easily at birth. The condition is associated with various dermatological and systemic manifestations. We report a case of this form of lipodystrophy. The patient had several cutaneous manifestations, including severe acanthosis nigricans, generalized hyperpigmentation, curly scalp hair, prominent subcutaneous veins, and enlarged clitoris. She also had associated celiac disease.
