Abstract : Profound changes in epithelial and lymphoid tissues were detected by the immunofluorescent technique in the thymus of myopathy patients. The characteristic immunomorphological manifestation indicating injuries to the thymic epithelial tissue is the sedimentation of IgG, IgA and complement in basal membranes and in the cytoplasm of adjacent poorly differentiated epithelial cells. Another remarkable sign of the changes in the thymic epithelial tissue during the disease is a sharply marked cystic degeneration of Hassall bodies, eventuating in the sedimentation of keratinized material in the internal environment of the organ. The changes in the thymic lymphoid tissue during myopathy are confirmed by the sedimentation of immune complex granules, containing IgM, IgA, IgG, and complement, in the intercellular space bordering individual groups of corticomedullar zone lymphocytes. The data obtained suggest that the thymic changes play an important part in the development and course of progressing muscle dystrophy.
