Abstract : Heritable abnormalities can cause a reduction in productive performance, structural defects, or death of the animal. There are reports of hereditary abnormalities in Braunvieh cattle from several countries, but no evidence was found on their existence in Mexico. In this study, 28 genes associated with hereditary diseases were screened with the GGP-LD 30K array (GeneSeek<sup>Â®</sup>) in 300 Mexican registered Braunvieh animals. Allelic frequencies of the markers associated with illness were obtained for the following: citrullinaemia, spinal dysmyelination, spinal muscular atrophy, Brows Swiss fertility haplotype 2, congenital muscular dystonia, epidermolysis bullosa, Pompes, maple syrup urine, syndactyly, Weaver syndrome, crooked tail, deficiency of uridine monophosphate synthase, hypotrichosis, Marfan syndrome, and weak calf syndrome. The allelic frequency values were low for all the analysed loci (from 0.0015 to 0.0110), with exception of syndactyly (0.4145). Although homozygous animals for these genetic conditions were detected, no physical or physiological abnormalities associated with the clinical form of the diseases were observed in the sampled animals. Markers associated with a crooked tail, deficiency of uridine monophosphate synthase, hypotrichosis, Marfan syndrome, and weak calf syndrome were absent. The studied Mexican Braunvieh population does not present clinical or subclinical effects for ten diseases in homozygous animals. However, since the assessed animals are considered as breeding stock, the monitoring of carrier animals might be periodically necessary.
