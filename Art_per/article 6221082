Abstract : Erythrocyte flexibility measured by a polycarbonate membrane filtration method showed increased fragility (265 +/- 163 Hb mg/l vs. controls 86 +/- 72 Hb mg/l; mean +/- SD; P less than 0.0025) and increased rigidity (123 +/- 96 mm Hg vs. 79 +/- 19 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) in patients with congenital myotonia, while both parameters were normal in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or with myotonic dystrophy. Erythrocyte ghosts obtained from patients with MyD displayed highly significant increases in both (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activities (P less than 0.005) and to a lesser extent in Mg2+-ATPase activity (P less than 0.05), while no difference was seen between patients with DMD and age-matched controls. The efflux of Ca2+ was increased from erythrocytes of patients with DMD as compared to age-matched controls (82 +/- 2% vs. 70 +/- 4%; P less than 0.005), while no difference was detected between patients with MyD and age-matched controls.
