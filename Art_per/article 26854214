Abstract : Vici syndrome is a rare congenital disorder first described in 1988. To date, 31 cases have been reported in the literature. The characteristic features of this syndrome include: agenesis of the corpus callosum, albinism, cardiomyopathy, variable immunodeficiency, cataracts, and myopathy. We report two Hispanic sisters with genetically confirmed Vici syndrome who both developed Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. To our knowledge, this is an immunologic process that has been previously undescribed within the phenotype of Vici syndrome and should be added to the spectrum of variable immune dysregulation that can be found in these patients.
