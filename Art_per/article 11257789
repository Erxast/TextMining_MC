Abstract : We described two patients, a mother and daughter, of Stormorken's syndrome. The syndrome is characterized clinically by autosomal dominant inheritance, congenital miosis, thrombocytopenia, asplenia and muscle weakness. Both patients had bleeding tendency, ichthyosis of arms, and muscle weakness. The daughter additionally had short stature (146 cm), low body weight (32 kg) and muscle cramp. Neurological findings of the patients included migraine-like headache, cognitive dysfunction, limitation of upward and lateral gaze, and amydriasis. Femoral muscle MRI of the daughter demonstrated decreased volume with patchy high intensity areas in the hamstrings. A muscle biopsy from the daughter showed myogenic changes with muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration, variation in fiber size, tubular aggregates in approximately 5% of fibers, and fibrous tissue proliferation. Dystrophin, dystrophin-associated proteins and dysferlin were normally expressed. Although both patients had elevated creatine kinase levels and generalized muscle wasting, muscle weakness was mild with slow progression. A certain membrane defect in the platelet and muscle fiber might be responsible for the pathogenesis of this syndrome.
