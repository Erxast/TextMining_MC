Abstract : Segmental uniparental isodisomy (iUPD) is a rare genetic event that may cause aberrant expression of imprinted genes, and reduction to homozygosity of a recessive mutation. Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is typically caused by imprinting aberrations in chromosome 6q24 TNDM differentially-methylated region (DMR). Approximately, 15.12â€‰Mb upstream in 6q22-q23 is located LAMA2, the gene responsible of merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A). We investigated a patient diagnosed both with TNDM and MDC1A, born from a twin dichorionic discordant pregnancy. Parents are first-degree cousins. Methylation sensitive-PCR of the imprinted 6q24 TNDM CpG island showed only the non-methylated (paternal) allele. Microsatellite markers and SNP array profiling disclosed normal biparental inheritance at 6p and a segmental paternal iUPD, between 6q22.33 and 6q27. Sequencing of LAMA2 exons showed a homozygous frameshift mutation, c.7490_7493dupAAGA, which predicts p.Asp2498GlufsX4, in exon 54. Her father, but not her mother, was a carrier of the mutation. While segmental paternal iUPD6 causing TNDM was reported twice, there are no previous reports of MDC1A caused by this event. This is a child with two genetic disorders, yet neither is caused by the parental consanguinity, which reinforces the importance of considering different etiological mechanisms in the genetic clinic.
