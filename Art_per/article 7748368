Title : Minimal somatic instability of CTG repeat in congenital myotonic dystrophy.
Date : 1995
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The molecular basis of myotonic dystrophy was identified as an unstable trinucleotide (CTG) repeat in the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA encoding a member of the protein kinase family. Unstable DNA was analyzed from various tissue samples of a patient with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy. In BamHI- or BglI-digested DNA, a normal band plus differently expanded ones were identified in various tissue samples. These observations demonstrated somatic instability of the repeat in a congenital myotonic dystrophy patient.
