Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Melorheostosis is a rare disorder marked by increased bony sclerosis on radiographs. In addition to bone changes, the skin and soft tissues overlying affected bone often demonstrate increased fibrosis, which can create joint contracture. These can all affect surgical planning for a patient with melorheostosis. This article reviews the literature and describes the surgical intervention and 4-year follow-up of a 10-year-old boy with melorheostosis.
