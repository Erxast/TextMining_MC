Title : Factors influencing different types of malocclusion and arch form-A review.
Date : 2021
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This review intends to highlight malocclusion as a multifactorial issue and review the different factors that influence different types of malocclusion and arch form.An online article search was performed on the factors influencing malocclusion and arch form from January 1990 through April 2020. The search was performed within the Google, Rutgers library, PubMed, MEDLINE databases via OVID using the keywords mentioned in the PubMed and MeSH headings for the English language published articles January 1990 through April 2020, which evaluated different factors that influence malocclusion and arch form.Of the 300 articles found in initial search results, 31 articles met the inclusion criteria set for this review. These 31 studies were directly related to the factors that impact malocclusion and different arch forms.Genetic inheritance, genetic mutations, age, gender, ethnicity, dental anomalies like macrodontia, congenital diseases, muscular diseases, hormone imbalance, and human behaviour are all factors that influence malocclusion and arch forms. The elements within the individual's control like behaviours can aid in preventing malocclusion. However, it seems as if the underlying reason for most of these factors indicates that malocclusion is a by-product of genetics and pathology.
