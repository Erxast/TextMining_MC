Title : Hallux varus as complication of foot compartment syndrome.
Date : 2011
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Hallux varus can present as a congenital deformity or it can be acquired secondary to trauma, surgery, or neuromuscular disease. In the present report, we describe the presence of hallux varus as a sequela of calcaneal fracture with entrapment of the medial plantar nerve in the calcaneal tunnel and recommend that clinicians be wary of this when they clinically, and radiographically, evaluate patients after calcaneal fracture.
