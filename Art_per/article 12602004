Abstract : Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is a degenerative disease that produces a limitation of mouth opening. In children, TMJ ankylosis usually presents with facial asymmetry, difficulty in feeding and rarely upper way obstruction. Ankylosis is commonly associated with trauma, infections, systemic and congenital diseases. Diagnosis must be clinical, being CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the most important methods to evaluate this disease. The treatment of TMJ ankylosis requires excision of the involved structures and reconstruction. We present our experience in treatment of the temporomandibular joint ankylosis. We have analysed the following parameters: age, sex, etiology, surgical technique, pre and postoperative oral opening.
