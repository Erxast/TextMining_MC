Abstract : Because many patients with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) are first examined by otolaryngologists for ear or speech problems before being diagnosed with VCFS, we describe a series of patients with this genetic disorder, which is associated with multiple anomalies, including velopharyngeal insufficiency, cardiac defects, characteristic facial features, and learning disabilities.We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts and available nasoendoscopic observations for 35 patients who were diagnosed with VCFS and who had a microscopic deletion in chromosome 22q11 as shown by DNA probe and fluorescence in situ hybridization.For most patients, the medical chart documented cardiac anomalies, velopharyngeal insufficiency with hypernasal speech, and characteristic facial features including nasal, auricular, craniofacial, and ocular abnormalities. Incidence of middle ear infection with associated conductive hearing loss was also high and necessitated early placement of pressure equalization tubes. Some patients were treated with adenoidectomy for chronic otitis media; consequently, velopharyngeal insufficiency and hypernasal speech worsened. Nasoendoscopic examination as documented in the medical chart showed occult cleft palate, a small adenoid pad, and pulsation in the muscular wall.Otolaryngologists have an important role in diagnosis and treatment of persons with VCFS and therefore should familiarize themselves with the typical history and most frequent head and neck manifestations of this syndrome.
