Abstract : To detect potential mutations of the spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (SACS) gene in a pedigree affected with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS).Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the proband and her family members. All exons and flanking sequences of the SACS gene were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Suspected mutations were verified with Sanger sequencing.Next generation sequencing revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations of the SACS gene, namely c.13085T to G (p.I4362R) and c.5236dupA (p.T1746fs), in the proband, which were respectively derived from her parents. The mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.The c.5236dupA (p.T1746fs) and c.13085T to G (p.I4362R) mutations of the SACS gene probably underlie the ocular symptoms and hearing loss in the proband.
