Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Hernia is defined as the protrusion of a totally or partially displaced organ from its normal visceral cavity. Most hernias occur at the level of the abdominal wall, because of a muscular defect. Pulmonary hernias are extremely rare and can be congenital or acquired. We present a 64-year-old patient who developed a spontaneous pulmonary hernia after a severe coughing episode. We describe the clinical features, diagnosis, and successful treatment.
