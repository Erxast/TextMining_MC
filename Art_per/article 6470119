Title : Orthopaedic aspects of the trismus pseudocamptodactyly syndrome.
Date : 1984
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The trismus pseudocamptodactyly syndrome is a relatively rare condition with autosomal dominant inheritance, characterized by decreased ability to open the mouth (trismus), interphalangeal flexion deformity with wrist extension (pseudocamptodactyly), various foot deformities, and slightly less than normal stature. Five affected individuals from one family are reviewed and the orthopaedic aspects are described. The presence of trismus is emphasized for the orthopaedic surgeon, as it may lead to anaesthetic complications during the treatment of the musculoskeletal problems.
