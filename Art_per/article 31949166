Abstract : α-Dystroglycan (α-DG) is a highly-glycosylated surface membrane protein. Defects in the O-mannosyl glycan of α-DG cause dystroglycanopathy, a group of congenital muscular dystrophies. The core M3 O-mannosyl glycan contains tandem ribitol-phosphate (RboP), a characteristic feature first found in mammals. Fukutin and fukutin-related protein (FKRP), whose mutated genes underlie dystroglycanopathy, sequentially transfer RboP from cytidine diphosphate-ribitol (CDP-Rbo) to form a tandem RboP unit in the core M3 glycan. Here, we report a series of crystal structures of FKRP with and without donor (CDP-Rbo) and/or acceptor [RboP-(phospho-)core M3 peptide] substrates. FKRP has N-terminal stem and C-terminal catalytic domains, and forms a tetramer both in crystal and in solution. In the acceptor complex, the phosphate group of RboP is recognized by the catalytic domain of one subunit, and a phosphate group on O-mannose is recognized by the stem domain of another subunit. Structure-based functional studies confirmed that the dimeric structure is essential for FKRP enzymatic activity.
