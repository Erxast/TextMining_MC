Title : Congenital fiber type disproportion myopathy in Lowe syndrome.
Date : 1989 Nov-Dec
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two brothers with the typical clinical features of oculocerebro-renal syndrome of Lowe exhibited delays in developmental milestones, muscular weakness and hypotonia, and high serum creatine kinase activity. The biopsied muscle revealed selective type 1 fiber atrophy and mild type 1 fiber predominance, similar to that observed in congenital fiber type disproportion myopathy. The abnormal fiber type distribution may be responsible for the common finding of muscle hypotonia in this syndrome.
