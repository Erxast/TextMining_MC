Title : Concepts of multiple congenital contractures (arthrogryposis) in man and animals.
Date : 1982
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This is a concept of multiple congenital contractures, based upon clinical experience with the malformation and available literature, leading to a conception of the multiple categories of etiology, which cause neuropathic or myopathic muscle weakness or limb immobilization. The muscle weakness and imbalance of muscle power around the joints elicits a physiological compensatory collagenic response, which replaces atrophied muscle fibers with connective tissue and thickens the joint capsule sufficiently to result in prenatal fixation of limb segments at the joint.
