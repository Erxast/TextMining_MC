Title : Cardiac involvement in primary myopathies.

Abstract : Simultaneous or temporarily staggered affection of both the skeletal as well as the cardiac muscle (cardiac involvement, CI) is a frequent finding in primary myopathies (MPs). CI leads to impulse generation defects, impulse conduction defects, thickened myocardium, left ventriculalr hypertrabeculation, dilatation of the cardiac cavities, secondary valve insufficiency, reduction of coronary vasodilative reserve, intracardial thrombus formation, and heart failure with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. CI has been found in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (MD), Becker MD, Emery-Dreifuss MD, facioscapulohumeral MD, sarcoglycanopathies, myotubular congenital MD, myotonic dystrophies type 1 and 2, proximal myotonic myopathy, myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, glycogenosis type II, III, IV, VII and IX, carnitine deficiency, mitochondriopathy, desmin MP, nemaline MP, central core disease, multicore MP, congenital fiber-type disproportion MP, Barth syndrome, McLeod syndrome and Bethlem MP. Patients with any of the above-mentioned myopathies should be cardiologically investigated as soon as their diagnosis is established, since sufficient cardiac therapy improves CI in MPs and since management of these patients is influenced by the degree of CI.
