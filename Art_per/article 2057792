Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We evaluated the knees of 62 patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita radiographically. Abnormal radiographs were noted in 34. The abnormalities consisted of both congenital and chronic changes secondary to long-standing clinical deformities including patellar elongation, malposition, flattening of the femoral condyles, joint incongruity, tibial plateau irregularities, tibial and femoral fractures, fibula hypoplasia, soft-tissue thickening, valgus deformity, and dislocation. The radiographic findings were consistent with the degree of longstanding physical deformity and can be used as a guide to the severity of the condition and the need for treatment.
