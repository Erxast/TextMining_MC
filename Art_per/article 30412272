Title : Novel SPEG mutations in congenital myopathies: Genotype-phenotype correlations.
Date : 2019
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Centronuclear myopathies (CNMs) are a subtype of congenital myopathies (CMs) characterized by muscle weakness, predominant type 1 fibers, and increased central nuclei. SPEG (striated preferentially expressed protein kinase) mutations have recently been identified in 7â€‰CM patients (6 with CNMs). We report 2 additional patients with SPEG mutations expanding the phenotype and evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations associated with SPEG mutations.Using whole exome/genome sequencing in CM families, we identified novel recessive SPEG mutations in 2 patients.Patient 1, with severe muscle weakness requiring respiratory support, dilated cardiomyopathy, ophthalmoplegia, and findings of nonspecific CM on muscle biopsy carried a homozygous SPEG mutation (p.Val3062del). Patient 2, with milder muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and CNM carried compound heterozygous mutations (p.Leu728Argfs*82) and (p.Val2997Glyfs*52).The 2 patients add insight into genotype-phenotype correlations of SPEG-associated CMs. Clinicians should consider evaluating a CM patient for SPEG mutations even in the absence of CNM features.
