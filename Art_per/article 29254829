Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is characterized by heterogeneous multiple congenital contractures appearing at birth. Mutations in X-linked zinc-finger gene ZC4H2 were recently identified in some families and individuals with variable forms of AMC associated with dysmorphic signs, intellectual disability and spastic paresis. We present a non-consanguineous Japanese female presenting AMC with severe intellectual disability and spastic quadriplegia who also had progressive brain atrophy. Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization identified 395â€¯kb microdeletions at Xq11.2 which only included ZC4H2 gene. Previous reports showed that affected females have lesser symptoms and slight abnormality on brain MRI compared to male due to X-inactivation. Our case, however, showed severe manifestation than as ever reported as well as progressive diffuse brain atrophy, which implicated contribution of other genetic or environmental factors or extremely skewed X inactivation.
