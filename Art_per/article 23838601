Abstract : Mitochondrial disorders are caused by defects in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. Although the existence of large deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is well known, deletions affecting whole genes are not commonly described in patients with mitochondrial disorders. Based on the results of whole-genome analyses, copy number variations (CNVs) occur frequently in the human genome and may overlap with many genes associated with clinical phenotypes. We report the discovery of two large heterozygous CNVs on 22q13.33 in two patients with mitochondrial disorders. The first patient harboured a novel point mutation c.667G>A (p.D223N) in the SCO2 gene in combination with a paternally inherited 87-kb deletion. As hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP) was not documented in the patient, this observation prompted us to compare his clinical features with all 44 reported SCO2 patients in the literature. Surprisingly, the review shows that HCMP was present in only about 50% of the SCO2 patients with non-neonatal onset. In the second patient, who had mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE), a maternally inherited 175-kb deletion and the paternally inherited point mutation c.261G>T (p.E87D) in the TYMP gene were identified.
