Title : Central core and nemaline rods in the same patient.
Date : 1998
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : It is quite rare, that central cores and nemaline bodies occur in the same individual. We describe the case of a 12-year-old girl, who was born with bilateral congenital hip dislocation. Her early motor milestones were delayed. Due to proximal weakness of the lower extremities she has never been able to walk. The family history was negative. Muscle histology, histochemistry and electron microscopic studies showed a central core in nearly all muscle fibers, and nemaline rods in a few. The earlier literature and new genetical findings concerning these muscle abnormalities are also briefly summarized.
