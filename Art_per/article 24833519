Date : 2014
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In this review, we illustrate the computed tomographic features of thoracoabdominal soft-tissue abnormalities, which may be easily overlooked and often can provide important information regarding systemic processes. Examples include necrotizing fasciitis, heterotopic ossification, fat necrosis, benign and malignant neoplasms, endometriosis, and collagen vascular disease as well as systemic and congenital pathology.
