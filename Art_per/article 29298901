Abstract : The purpose of this study was to investigate the 5-year outcomes of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) application in different neuromuscular disease (NMD) groups.We categorized 180 subjects who had initiated NIV between March 2001 and August 2009 into 4 groups and followed them for > 5 y. The NIV maintenance rate and average duration, applying time, and forced vital capacity (FVC) were investigated at the time NIV was initiated and 5 y after NIV initiation in each group.In subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)-congenital myopathy, the 5-year subjects who continued to use NIV over time were 22.5%, 89.4%, and 91.3%, respectively, and the average NIV maintenance durations were 21.53 ± 19.26 months, 55.22 ± 11.47 months, and 57.48 ± 8.34 months, respectively (<i>P</i> < .001). Median daily applying time changed from 8.0 h to 24.0 h (<i>P</i> < .001), from 8.0 h to 12.0 h (<i>P</i> < .001), and from 8.0 h to 9.0 h (<i>P</i> = .11) in subjects with ALS, DMD, and SMA-congenital myopathy, respectively. FVC decreased significantly after 5 y except in the group with combined SMA-congenital myopathy.NIV was tolerated long-term without significant increases in daily application time for most subjects with NMD. However, in individuals with ALS, development of severe bulbar symptoms can risk maintaining NIV.
