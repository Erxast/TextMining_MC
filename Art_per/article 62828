Title : Erythrocyte ghosts (Na+ + K+) ATPase activity in Duchenne's dystrophy and myotonia.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In Duchenne muscular dystrophy the activity of (Na+ + K+)ATPase in erythrocyte ghosts is reduced and its reaction to ouabain is paradoxical both in low sodium and high sodium systems. No such changes were seen in a case of Becker dystrophy, in limb-girdle dystrophy, and in neurogenic atrophy of muscles. In myotonic dystrophy and congenital myotonia the activity of ATPase and its inhibition by ouabain were depressed.
