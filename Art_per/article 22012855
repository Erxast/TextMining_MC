Abstract : Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome is a fatal disorder mostly diagnosed during infancy and caused by mutations of mitochondrial DNA. We hereby report on four children affected by Pearson syndrome with hematological disorders at onset. The disease was fatal to three of them and the fourth one, who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, died of secondary malignancy. In this latter patient transplantation corrected hematological and non-hematological issues like metabolic acidosis, and we therefore argue that it could be considered as a useful option in an early stage of the disease.
