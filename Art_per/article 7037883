Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A review is made of superficial fibrous tumors of childhood and differences between the pattern of fibrous tumor proliferation in children and adults are discussed. The fibrous tumors that occur specifically in childhood and infancy include recurring digital fibrous tumor, juvenile aponeurotic fibroma (cartilage analogue of fibromatosis), juvenile hyalin fibromatosis, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, congenital fibromatosis and fibromatosis colli (Torticollis). Palmoplantar fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma may appear in all ages. Dupuytren contracture, however, is not usually observed early in life. Similarly, the histiocytomas and dermatofibromas which are the most common fibrous tumors of adults are extremely rare in childhood.
