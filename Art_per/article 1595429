Abstract : The Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by lissencephaly, cerebellar and retinal malformations, and congenital muscular dystrophy. We report a new case of WWS identified with the aid of cranial MR and briefly review the radiologic findings of this lethal syndrome.
