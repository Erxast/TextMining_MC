Abstract : In order to better characterize the biological features of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, we reviewed the histopathological specimens from eleven patients (twelve biopsies) who had a confirmed diagnosis of the disease. All of the biopsies had been performed in children, to exclude the diagnosis of a malignant lesion. In no instance was the diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva considered before the biopsy. The results of a lesional biopsy in all eleven patients revealed normal endochondral osteogenesis at heterotopic sites. The results of biopsy of an early lesion in six children were misinterpreted as revealing a diagnosis of fibromatosis or sarcoma before the roentgenographic appearance of ossification. Immunohistochemical studies of sections of the earliest lesion demonstrated S-100 antigen positivity before the histological appearance of differentiated osteochondral tissue. The presence of congenital malformation of the great toes and of postnatal heterotopic endochondral osteogenesis strongly suggests that fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a disorder of defective induction of endochondral osteogenesis. This study established the predominant histopathological findings associated with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and can serve as a basis for postulation of a candidate gene in the pathogenesis of the disorder. A lesional biopsy is not needed to make the diagnosis; biopsy uniformly exacerbates the condition and should be avoided.
