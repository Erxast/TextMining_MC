Abstract : Temporal bone imaging in children shows radioanatomical aspects and diseases distinct from the imaging and pathology results found in adults. Imaging modalities such as CT and MR bring out these differences. The aim of this study is to present the CT and MR particularities of the temporal bone during postnatal growth. The mastoid air cells form mostly in the postnatal period and the course of pneumatization is directly correlated with middle ear successive inflammatory episodes. The most frequent etiologies of hearing loss in children are reviewed, emphasizing their specificities in clinical presentation, radiological aspects, and treatment. In children, conductive hearing loss with normal tympanic membrane is mostly caused by minor aplasia rather than otosclerosis. Sensorineural hearing loss, even when unilateral, is predominantly due to malformation or infection and in rare cases to posterior fossa tumor.
