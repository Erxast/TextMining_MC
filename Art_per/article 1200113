Title : Ocular manifestations of systemic diseases.
Date : 1975
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The purpose of this review is to keep the optometrist informed as to the latest developments in the field of Ophthalmology. Papers reviewed are, almost exclusively, those published between Oct. 1st, 1973 and Sept. 30th, 1974. Emphasis will be placed on signs and symptoms of the disorders which are helpful in their detection or confirmation. No rare disorders will be discussed and although the literature has been especially rich in single cases this past year, they have been, for the most part, omitted from this review. Thus, to an ophthalmologist, the selection may appear arbitrary and incomplete. For purposes of reviewing, as in previous years, diseases reviewed are divided into non infectious and infectious. Infectious diseases are grouped according to the organ system or the system function predominantly affected, including hereditary and/or congenital diseases. The infectious diseases are grouped as to the causative pathogenic organism.
