Abstract : Skeletal muscle maturation is impaired in children with congenital myotonic dystrophy. This immaturity is characterized at the light microscopy level by an abnormal presence of myotubes, small fascicles of muscle fibers, thin myofibers, and delayed muscle fiber type differentiation with a peripheral halo lacking mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activity. At an ultrastructural level, the characteristics are a paucity of myofibrils with a peripheral rim devoid of mitochondria and myofibrils in the fibers. In time the muscle is able to gain a certain degree of maturity as shown in one of our cases who had two successive muscle biopsies. The muscle, however, never becomes normal but retains discrepancies in fiber size and fiber type distribution and shows some fiber necrosis. Maturation of the motoneurons is normal, which may explain necrosis of immature muscle fibers. In an experimental study carried out to look for evidence of a circulatory factor in mothers of children with congenital myotonic dystrophy, it was found that sera from these mothers administered intra-peritoneally to newborn rats does in fact impair muscle maturation, whereas rats injected similarly with sera from control women showed normal muscle maturation.
