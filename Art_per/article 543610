Abstract : Webs and contracture, whether congenital or the result of trauma or surgical excision, have been resurfaced with local tissue utilizing the principle of multiple Y-V advancement flaps.  Initially the procedure was used in releasing broad scar contracture following a burn wound of the torso, and for congenital soft tissue shortening of the dorsum of the foot, both with gratifying results.  The procedure was later used to obtain adjacent soft tissue for resurfacing defects of the nasal tip or ala, resulting from trauma and following the excision of a tumor. (For example, it enabled us to compensate for a rotation flap defect.)  It is also useful for additional release of scar contractures of the digits and extremities after transposition of Z-plasty flaps, which can be further advanced using the Y-V advancement principle.
