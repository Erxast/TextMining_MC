Abstract : VLCAD deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect of fatty acid oxidation. The phenotype is classified into three clinical forms on the basis of the onset of symptoms: a severe form with neonatal onset; a milder form with childhood onset; and a late-onset form. The neonatal form is the most common, and has a higher mortality rate than the others. We report the case of a newborn infant with VLCAD deficiency who developed ventricular fibrillation, which was successfully treated by intensive care, but who suddenly died after a respiratory syncytial virus infection. Early institution of i.v. glucose treatment and active immunization with vaccine, such as palivizumab (anti-RSV mAb), may be important to reduce the frequency and severity of life-threatening episodes.
