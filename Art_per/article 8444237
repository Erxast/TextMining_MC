Title : Restrictive dermopathy: a lethal congenital skin disorder.
Date : 1993
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Restrictive dermopathy is a recently described lethal congenital disorder of the skin with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The rigidity of the skin impairs fetal movements in utero and causes arthrogryposis, as well as highly characteristic facial features and pulmonary hypoplasia. We report two cases of restrictive dermopathy in prematurely born infants, describe the typical pathological findings and discuss this disorder in the context of the fetal akinesia/hypokinesia deformation sequence.
