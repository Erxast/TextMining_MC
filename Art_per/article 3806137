Abstract : Undifferentiated type 2C fibers and satellite cells were increased in number in younger patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD) indicating immaturity in muscle fiber growth. The changes found in a 38-year-old man with CMD were identical to those described in late onset myotonic dystrophy. Type 1 fibers were found to become predominant with age. This suggests that in this disorder fiber type transformation progresses with age, presumably due to abnormal neural influences or aberrant sarcolemmal responses.
