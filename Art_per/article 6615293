Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : An intrinsic foot muscle biopsy specimen was taken from a patient with myotubular myopathy who underwent surgical correction for orthopedic deformity. Pathologic findings were typical of primary muscle disease. Foot deformity in myotubular myopathy may result from abnormalities of intrinsic foot muscles, as well as those of more proximal musculature.
