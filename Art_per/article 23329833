Title : The o-mannosylation pathway: glycosyltransferases and proteins implicated in congenital muscular dystrophy.
Date : 2013
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Several forms of congenital muscular dystrophy, referred to as dystroglycanopathies, result from defects in the protein O-mannosylation biosynthetic pathway. In this minireview, I discuss 12 proteins involved in the pathway and how they play a role in the building of glycan structures (most notably on the protein Î±-dystroglycan) that allow for binding to multiple proteins of the extracellular matrix.
