Abstract : It has been hypothesized that the tight localization of dystrophin at the muscle membrane is carried out by its cysteine-rich and/or carboxyl domains. We report the results of biochemical and immunocytochemical investigations of dystrophin in muscle from a 1-yr-old patient with a large deletion that removes the distal part of the dystrophin gene, thus spanning the exons coding for the cysteine-rich and the carboxy-terminal domains, and extends beyond the glycerol kinase and congenital adrenal hypoplasia genes. Immunological analysis of muscle dystrophin shows that the deletion results in the production of a truncated, but stable, polypeptide correctly localized at the sarcolemma. These data indicate that neither the cysteine-rich domain, nor the carboxyl domain, are necessary for the appearance of normal dystrophin sarcolemmal localization.
