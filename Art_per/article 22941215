Date : 2013
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Nemaline myopathy, also called rod myopathy, is a relatively common congenital myopathy and probably second in incidence only to central core disease. The mainstay of diagnosis is histopathology, but detection of the causative mutation is mandatory for determining the mode of inheritance and for prenatal diagnosis. The authors report two siblings with nemaline myopathy caused by mutations in the nebulin gene.
