Title : Congenital extension contracture of metacarpophalangeal joints.
Date : 1997
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a case of congenital extension contracture of the fifth metacarpophalangeal joints in a 15-year-old boy who had no associated anomalies and was successfully treated by surgery. Congenital extension contracture of bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints has not been reported previously, and the entity can be considered to be a new subgroup of distal arthrogryposis with congenital distal limb contracture.
