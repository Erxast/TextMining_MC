Abstract : X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder associated with mutations in the <i>MTM1</i> gene on the Xq28 region. We report a severely affected girl with XLMTM, caused by maternally inherited 661â€‰kb Xq28 microduplication identified by chromosomal microarray analysis and confirmed also on DNA from muscle biopsy with a custom-designed X-chromosome-specific microarray. X-inactivation analysis revealed a skewed inactivation pattern on the proband's muscle biopsy. Muscle biopsy histopathology was indicative of increased variability in fiber diameter, marked and diffuse endomysial proliferation of adipose and connective tissues, as well as predominance of type 1 fibers.
