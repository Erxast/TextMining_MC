Title : X-linked myotubular myopathy: a linkage study.
Date : 1990
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two families with the congenital X-linked infantile form of myotubular myopathy have been investigated by linkage analysis using markers from the X-chromosome. Linkage was found at the locus Xq28 (with DXS52). The analysis gave a peak lod score of 2.41 at the recombination fraction zero. Free recombinations (theta = 0.50) were seen using the markers DXS84, DXS14 and DXS146 from the p arm of the X-chromosome. Since the disorder is very rare, it is important to add cumulative linkage data from the few families that do exist.
