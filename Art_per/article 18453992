Abstract : The surgical treatment of large and giant congenital pigmented nevi of the lower extremity is a challenging endeavor with limited reconstructive options.Fifty large (>10 cm) and giant (>20 cm) congenital pigmented nevi of the lower extremity treated by the senior author (B.S.B.) over a 25-year period were reviewed. All of these nevi were too large for serial excision or direct closure.A reconstructive algorithm based on the extent and location (thigh, knee, popliteal fossa, leg, and foot) of the nevus is proposed. The approach to each anatomical region is described in detail, along with nuances of tissue expansion in the extremities.Treating large and giant congenital pigmented nevi of the lower extremity requires careful planning and often multiple stages. An evolution of the authors' approach to these lesions has led to improved outcomes. Contour and the limiting of scar contracture around the joints are of paramount importance.
