Abstract : A personal technique is described for reconstruction of the first web-space in congenital hand deformities with severe adduction of the thumb. The technique is based on the use of two local rotation flaps, one designed on the thenar area and the other on the radial half of the back of the hand. Seven patients were treated with such a technique and followed up for an average of 32 months. Excellent results were obtained in five cases.
