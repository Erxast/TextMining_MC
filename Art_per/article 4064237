Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The congenital insensitivity to pain regroups some rare diseases which are mainly 5: congenital insensitivity to pain; congenital sensitive neuropathies; distal sensitive neuropathies; Riley-Day syndrome or hereditary dysautonomia; at last, miscellaneous troubles. Three different cases are reported in children: true congenital insensitivity to pain; hereditary dysautonomia or Riley-Day syndrome; congenital insensitivity to pain localised to a lower limb joined to amniotic disease and abnormality of this limb. The orthopedic symptoms (osteomyelitis, arthropathies as Charcot type, dislocations, fractures) lead often to diagnosis and they are an important step of the prognosis. Scoliosis seems to be frequent in this disease. The orthopedic and surgical treatment, according to each localization, is difficult and must emphasize the prevention of bones and joints injuries.
