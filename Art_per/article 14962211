Title : The spectrum of myositis ossiticans in haemophilia.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Myositis ossificans (MO) refers to non-neoplastic heterotopic soft tissue ossification that can have several aetiologies. Broadly it can be classified into three categories based on aetiology [1]. MO traumatica, the most common form occurs secondary to acute or chronic trauma. MO can also be associated with neurological disorders and in rare cases is congenital. The latter (progressive MO) is a genetic disorder in which congenital osseous abnormalities are associated with progressive soft tissue calcification. Despite an increased tendency to soft tissue bleeds, MO has been rarely reported in haemophilia. We treated three adolescents with haemophilia and MO of varying degrees of severity and outcome.
