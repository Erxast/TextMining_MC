Title : Middle ear deformity in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.
Date : 1994
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a rare congenital syndrome consisting of two or more joint contractures in different parts of the body. Otolaryngological abnormalities have been previously described in a significant proportion of cases. However, to date, the only frequent otologic deformity recorded in the published literature has been low-set ears. We present a case with a combination of AMC and a bilateral conductive hearing loss due to an unusual middle ear deformity. To our knowledge, no such case has been previously reported.
