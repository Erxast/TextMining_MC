Abstract : Twenty-three of 36 patients (64%) with Rett syndrome showed orthopedic problems at an average age of 8 years 7 months. Sixteen patients had spinal deformities (45%), six had scoliosis, one had sagittal deformity, and nine had scoliosis with sagittal deformity. Eight patients with scoliosis have shown progression, with two patients requiring surgery. Thirteen patients (36%) exhibited joint contractures; three of them have required surgery. Ten fractures occurred in five patients (14%). Coxa valga was present in all 14 hips. Skeletal ages in four preadolescent patients were normal.
