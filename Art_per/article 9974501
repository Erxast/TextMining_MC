Title : Imaging of the pediatric orbit and visual pathways: computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
Date : 1999
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Techniques for pediatric MR imaging and computed tomography and anatomy of the orbit and intracranial visual pathways are presented and reviewed in this article. Imaging findings are presented for the following categories of abnormality: a) orbital anomalies related to congenital disorders of the brain, b) disorders of the orbit (ocular, nonocular, or multicompartmental), c) disorders of the intracranial visual pathways (suprasellar cistern, optic radiations, or occipital cortex), and d) disorders of gaze (extraocular muscles, cranial nerves, and brainstem). Careful assessment of the clinical findings, anatomic location of the visual impairment, and familiarity with disorders that often affect pediatric patients are helpful in guiding neuroimaging evaluation of the child with ocular, orbital, or central patterns of visual disturbance.
