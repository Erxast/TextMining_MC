Title : [Myocardiopathy disclosing a centronuclear myopathy in an adult].
Date : 1986
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors report the case of a primary myocardiopathy of the young adult, related in fact to a rare muscular congenital disease: centro-nuclear myopathy. The case is different from the classic picture in that it is revealed late, by its cardiac manifestations which dominate the clinical picture and lead to an irreducible cardiac insufficiency requiring a heart transplant. Only a muscular biopsy with histological and histo chemical study permits to make the diagnosis, while the lesions of the myocardium are non-specific.
