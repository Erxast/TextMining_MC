Abstract : The time courses of changes in amplitudes of muscle action potentials (MAPs) obtained from gastrocnemius and soleus muscles by 5 Hz prolonged tibial nerve stimulation were studied. Subjects included muscular dystrophy (MD), spinal muscular atrophy, Issacs syndrome, idiopathic muscle spasms, psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, and normal controls. In normal subjects, MAPs obtained at 5 minutes from gastrocnemius muscles was 87-102% of those at initiation of the stimulation. In soleus muscles, MAPs at 5 minutes was 95-105% of those at the beginning. In gastrocnemius muscles, MAPs increased in disorders such as Duchenne MD, Fukuyama type congenital MD, facioscapulohumeral MD, myotonic dystrophy, dermatomyositis, Kugelberg-Welander syndrome, viral myelitis, malignant hyperpyrexia, autism and schizophrenia. In soleus muscles, the increase of MAPs was demonstrated in Duchenne MD, Fukuyama type congenital MD, myotonic dystrophy and autism. MAPs remained within normal range in infants with Werdnig-Hoffman disease, Issacs syndrome and idiopathic muscle spasms. In two cases with Duchenne MD, MAPs obtained from gastrocnemius muscles reduced in amplitudes by the administration of dantrolen sodium. While the pathogenesis of the increased MAPs is not clear, several possible factors are discussed. It is considered that this 5 Hz examination may provide an important information for detecting the effect of dantrolen sodium on Duchenne MD, and it is also suggested that the examination will be a useful test for finding latent malignant hyperpyrexia.
