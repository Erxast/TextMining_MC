Abstract : Myotubular myopathy, also called X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XL-CNM), is a severe congenital disease targeted for therapeutic trials. To date, biomarkers to monitor disease progression and therapy efficacy are lacking. The <i>Mtm1</i><sup>-/y</sup> mouse is a faithful model for XL-CNM, due to myotubularin 1 (<i>MTM1</i>) loss-of-function mutations. Using both an unbiased approach (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) and a directed approach (qRT-PCR and protein level), we identified decreased <i>Mstn</i> levels in <i>Mtm1</i><sup>-/y</sup> muscle, leading to low levels of myostatin in muscle and plasma. Myostatin (<i>Mstn</i> or growth differentiation factor 8 [<i>Gdf8</i>]) is a protein released by myocytes and inhibiting muscle growth and differentiation. Decreasing <i>Dnm2</i> by genetic cross with <i>Dnm2</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice or by antisense oligonucleotides blocked or postponed disease progression and resulted in an increase in circulating myostatin. In addition, plasma myostatin levels inversely correlated with disease severity and with <i>Dnm2</i> mRNA levels in muscles. Altered <i>Mstn</i> levels were associated with a generalized disruption of the myostatin pathway. Importantly, in two different forms of CNMs we identified reduced circulating myostatin levels in plasma from patients. This provides evidence of a blood-based biomarker that may be used to monitor disease state in XL-CNM mice and patients and supports monitoring circulating myostatin during clinical trials for myotubular myopathy.
