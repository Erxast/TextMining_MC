Abstract : Nemaline rod disease is a congenital myopathy, presentation of which may mimic myasthenia gravis.We report a suspected case of nemaline rod disease in a female adolescent who presented with features similar to myasthenia gravis but failed to respond effectively to its conventional management. She had features of respiratory failure and cardiomyopathy.Patient had a turbulent clinical course and finally succumbed to illness on the fifth day of admission.This report is meant to sensitize child neurologists and general paediatricians on the need to have a broad spectrum of considerations in the management of suspected myasthenia gravis, especially when response to anticholinesterase is poor.
