Abstract : The aim of the present paper was to study the myopathic bone both from the morphological and structural viewpoints. To this end, samples from 8 patients affected by different neuromuscular diseases (DMD, SMA and CMD) have been examined. Thus, by SEM analysis a quantitative reduction of the trabeculae and an increase in porosity of the myopathic bone were found and also, by diffractometric analysis, the presence of pathologic crystalline phases (beta-TCP and beta-TCP-Mg).
