Title : Congenital upper lid coloboma.
Date : 1986
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Twenty-two patients with congenital upper lid colobomas were assessed. Strabismus occurred in 13 cases and was associated with bands of fibrous tissue or adhesions, high refractive errors and opacities in the ocular media. A traction test is strongly recommended early in all children with congenital upper lid colobomas. A lateral cantholysis and direct closure was the commonest type of surgery, but unless the coloboma closed easily a lower lid rotation flap gave the best results.
