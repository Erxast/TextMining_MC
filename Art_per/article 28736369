Abstract : To investigate the significance of early screening of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) using ultrasonography and establish a simultaneous screening model for pediatric DDH and CMT.From January, 2013 to January, 2016, a total of 5060 pediatric patients with suspected DDH and CMT underwent ultrasonic examinations. The diagnostic results of the two diseases were classified into different clinical types, and Chi-square test was used to analyze the one-way relationship between different types of DDH and CMT; correspondence analysis was used for multivariate analysis of the variables. Chi-square test was used to analyze the difference between the detection rates in suspected CMT patients and the normal population.GrafIIa type DDH was associated with mass-type CMT in the children (χ<sup>2</sup>=331.800, P<0.001). DDH of GrafIIb, GrafIIc, Graf III, and Graf IV types were related with non-tumor type of CMT. The children with a suspected diagnosis of CMT showed a significantly higher detection rate of DDH than the normal subjects (χ<sup>2</sup>=321.889, P<0.001).DDH is closely related with CMT. Early simultaneous screening of DDH and CMT can help to improve the early diagnosis rate of CMT in children.
