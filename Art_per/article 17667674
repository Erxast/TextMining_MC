Abstract : Arthrogryposis is the name given to a group of musculoskeletal disorders characterized by multiple joint contractures through the body that are present at birth. There are many causes for congenital limitations of the range of motion of a joint. However, the most common form of arthrogryposis, present in 40% of cases, is a condition called amyoplasia. In many cases, abnormal nerve, muscle, and connective tissue development is involved. Hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, feet, knees, back, and jaws are affected. Because of the complexity of tissue alterations and implications in normal facial growth, the authors of this article address the aspects related to clinical manifestations and therapeutic planning for patients with this condition who seek orthodontic treatment or orthognathic surgery.
