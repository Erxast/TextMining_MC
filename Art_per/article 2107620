Title : Evidence that Cache Valley virus induces congenital malformations in sheep.

Abstract : An outbreak of congenital abnormalities occurred in sheep at San Angelo, Texas, between December 1986 and February 1987. Of 360 lambs born, 19.2% had arthrogryposis or other musculo-skeletal problems and hydranencephaly (AGH), and the total neonatal loss was 25.6%. In 1987, all ewes that were tested with AGH lambs had antibody to Cache Valley virus (CVV), whereas 62% of the ewes with normal lambs had CVV-specific antibody. Pre-colostral serum samples from AGH lambs had neutralizing antibody to CVV. An increase in prevalence of CVV-specific antibody, from 5% during the spring of 1986 to 63.4% during the winter of 1987, occurred during a time that included the gestation of these affected lambs, as well as a period of increased rainfall. The isolation of a CVV-related strain from a sentinel sheep in October 1987 confirmed the continued presence of this virus in the pasture where this outbreak occurred and provided a recent field strain for future studies.
