Abstract : Patients with short congenital amputations below the elbow often function as if they have had a disarticulation of the elbow. We have reviewed the results in six patients who had lengthening of such stumps by the Ilizarov technique to improve the fitting of prostheses. The mean lengthening was 5.6 cm (3.4 to 8.4), and in two patients flexion contractures of the elbows were corrected simultaneously. Additional lateral distraction was used in one patient to provide a better surface on the stump. There were no major complications. All six patients were able to use their prosthesis at the latest follow-up after 39 to 78 months.
