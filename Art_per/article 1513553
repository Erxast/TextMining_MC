Abstract : We report an autopsy case of 4-day-old male infant with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita studied by histological methods in respect to the ocular tissues. The eye examined was normal in size, and the retina, optic nerve, choroid, sclera and extracocular muscle showed no remarkable histological changes. However, the cornea was thickened, and the iris, trabecular tissue and ciliary body showed maldevelopmental changes, which were all compatible with goniodysgenesis. The clinical data of this case did not demonstrate any signs of congenital glaucoma, but the present study indicates that an infant with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita has a potential for infantile glaucoma with goniodysgenesis.
