Abstract : Next-generation sequencing has led to transformative advances in our ability to diagnose rare diseases by simultaneously sequencing dozens, hundreds, or even entire genomes worth of genes to efficiently identify pathogenic mutations. These studies amount to multiple hypothesis testing on a massive scale and not infrequently lead to discovery of multiple genetic variants whose relative contributions to a patient's disease are unclear. Panel testing, in particular, can be problematic because each of the many genes being sequenced might represent a plausible explanation for a given case. We performed targeted gene panel analysis of 43 established neuromuscular disease genes in a patient with congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD) and fatal infantile cardiomyopathy. Initial review of variants identified changes in four genes that could be considered relevant candidates to cause this child's disease. Further analysis revealed that two of these are likely benign, but a homozygous frameshift variant in the myosin light chain 2 gene, <i>MYL2</i>, and a heterozygous nonsense mutation in the nebulin gene, <i>NEB</i>, met criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic. Recessive <i>MYL2</i> mutations are a rare cause of CFTD associated with both skeletal and cardiomyopathy, whereas recessive <i>NEB</i> mutations cause nemaline myopathy. Although the proband's phenotype is likely largely explained by the <i>MYL2</i> variant, the heterozygous pathogenic <i>NEB</i> variant cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor. This case illustrates the complexity when analyzing large numbers of variants from targeted gene panels in which each of the genes might plausibly contribute to the patient's clinical presentation.
