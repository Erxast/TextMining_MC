Date : 1978
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : An 18-month-boy developed a calcifying mass in the gastrocnemius muscle. The lesion presented on the day of birth and resolved completely within 5 months leaving only a fibrous cord replacing the medial head of the gastrocnemius. There were no facts in the history to suggest the etiology of this lesion. Calcification of a vascular hamartoma with subsequent fibrosis is proposed as a possible explanation. The benign course of this lesion is evidence of the value of conservative treatment.
