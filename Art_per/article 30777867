Abstract : Arthrogryposis is a group of phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by congenital contractures of two or more parts of the body; the pathogenesis and the causative genes of arthrogryposis remain undetermined. We examined a four-generation arthrogryposis pedigree characterized by camptodactyly, limited forearm supination, and loss of myofibers in the forearms and hands. By using whole-exome sequencing, we confirmed <i>MET</i> p.Y1234C mutation to be responsible for arthrogryposis in this pedigree. <i>MET</i> p.Y1234C mutation caused the failure of activation of MET tyrosine kinase. A <i>Met</i> p.Y1232C mutant mouse model was established. The phenotypes of homozygous mice included embryonic lethality and complete loss of muscles that originated from migratory precursors. Heterozygous mice were born alive and showed reduction of the number of myofibers in both appendicular and axial muscles. Defective migration of muscle progenitor cells and impaired proliferation of secondary myoblasts were proven to be responsible for the skeletal muscle dysplasia of mutant mice. Overall, our study shows <i>MET</i> to be a causative gene of arthrogryposis and <i>MET</i> mutation could cause skeletal muscle dysplasia in human beings.
