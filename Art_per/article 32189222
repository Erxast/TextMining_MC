Abstract : Rapid progress in knowledge of the organization of the dog genome has facilitated the identification of the mutations responsible for numerous monogenic diseases, which usually present a breed-specific distribution. The majority of these diseases have clinical and molecular counterparts in humans. The affected dogs have thus become valuable models for preclinical studies of gene therapy for problems such as eye diseases, immunodeficiency, lysosomal storage diseases, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy. Successful gene therapies in dogs have significantly contributed to decisions to run clinical trials for several human diseases, such as Leber's congenital amaurosis 2-LCA2 (caused by a mutation of RPE65), X-linked retinitis pigmentosa-XLRP (caused by mutation RPGR), and achromatopsia (caused by mutation of CNGB3). Promising results were also obtained for canine as follows: hemophilia (A and B), mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS I, MPS IIIB, MPS VII), leukocyte adhesion deficiency (CLAD), and muscular dystrophy (a counterpart of human Duchenne dystrophy). Present knowledge on molecular background of canine monogenic diseases and their successful gene therapies prove that dogs have an important contribution to preclinical studies.
