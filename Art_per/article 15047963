Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 25 year old man with known chronic right sided heart failure and ascites due to a congenital heart defect presented with dyspnoea and a massive pleural effusion. Thoracoscopy revealed two diaphragmatic blebs. Changes in peritoneal and thoracic pressure during respiration resulted in periodic squirting of a ruptured bleb, illustrating preferential flow of peritoneal fluid into the thorax. The pleural effusion was successfully treated with drainage of ascitic fluid and chemical pleurodesis.
