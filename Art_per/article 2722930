Abstract : We report four children with sternomastoid contracture combined with torticolis secondary to congenital vertebral anomalies. Two had features of Klippel-Feil syndrome and a proximal release of the contracted sternomastoid produced good cosmetic correction initially. Progression of the deformity occurred subsequently without recurrence of sternomastoid contracture. One child had such mild deformity that it was merely observed. The fourth child was born with torticollis without sternomastoid tightness and a vertebral anomaly was later recognised. He slowly developed a sternomastoid contracture and his condition was considerably improved by sternomastoid release. This combination of causes of torticollis has not, as far as we know, been previously reported. The clinician should be aware of it and should also realise that radiographs of the very immature spine may not disclose the bony anomalies.
