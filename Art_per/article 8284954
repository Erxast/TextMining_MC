Abstract : In four new-born Braunvieh calves suffering from connate recumbency and body tremor, a hitherto not described myelination disorder of the spinal cord was examined. Bilateral symmetric hypo- as well as demyelination in several spinal tracts were the most conspicuous findings, affecting the ascending gracile funiculus, the ascending dorsolateral spinocerebellar tract, and the mainly descending sulcomarginal tract. Deficient myelin production, loss of myelin, consecutive axonal degenerations, and prominent astrogliosis within these tracts were the histological hallmarks of the disease. This possibly inherited primary myelination disorder of the spinal cord differs markedly from known hereditary neurological diseases in Brown Swiss and Braunvieh cattle, respectively, i.e. the weaver-syndrome and the spinal muscular atrophy.
