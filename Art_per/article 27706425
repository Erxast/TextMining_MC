Abstract : Neuromuscular junction disorders represent a wide group of neurological diseases characterized by weakness, fatigability and variable degrees of appendicular, ocular and bulbar musculature involvement. Its main group of disorders includes autoimmune conditions, such as autoimmune acquired myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome. However, an important group of diseases include congenital myasthenic syndromes with a genetic and sometimes hereditary basis that resemble and mimick many of the classic myasthenia neurological manifestations, but also have different presentations, which makes them a complex clinical, therapeutic and diagnostic challenge for most clinicians. We conducted a wide review of congenital myasthenic syndromes in their clinical, genetic and therapeutic aspects.
