Abstract : Hereditary nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital myopathies with the histopathological findings of nemaline bodies. We used targeted next-generation sequencing to identify causative mutations in 48 NM patients with confirmed myopathological diagnosis, analyze the mutational spectrum and phenotypic features. Furthermore, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the pathogenic effect of one nebulin (NEB) splicing variant. The results showed that variants were found in five NM-associated genes, including NEB, actin alpha 1 (ACTA1), troponin T1, Kelch repeat and BTB domain-containing 13, and cofilin-2, in 34 (73.9%), 7 (15.2%), 3 (6.5%), 1 (2.2%), and 1 (2.2%) patients, respectively, in a total of 46/48 (95.8%) NM patients. Of the total 64 variants identified, 51 were novel variants including 26 pathogenic, 1 probably pathogenic, and 24 variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Notably, one NEB splicing mutation, c.21417+3A>G causing exon 144 splicing (NM_001164508.1), as confirmed by RT-PCR, was found in 52.9% (18 patients) of NEB variant-carrying patients. Typical congenital NM, the most common clinical subtype (60.4%), was associated with five NM genes. We concluded that hereditary NM showed a highly variable genetic spectrum. NEB was the most frequent causative gene in this Chinese cohort, followed by ACTA1. We found a hotspot splicing mutation in NEB among Chinese cohort.
