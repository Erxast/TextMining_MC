Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy is a progressive multisystem disorder that may be inherited from either parent, although only children with affected mothers usually show the more severe congenital form of the condition; others are classified as having adult myotonic dystrophy. Since 1940, 29 patients with myotonic dystrophy (10 adult, 17 congenital, two unclassified) have been followed at the Alfred I. duPont Institute. Treatment protocols have been established for the treatment of talipes equinovarus deformity commonly seen in the congenital form of myotonic dystrophy, as well as the progressive dropfoot gait more commonly seen in the adult form.
