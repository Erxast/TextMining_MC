Abstract : Congenital disorders of glycosylation are caused by defects in the synthesis of the glycan moiety of glycoproteins or other glycoconjugates. There has been a great explosion in the number of neuromuscular diseases caused by mutations in genes that affect carbohydrate metabolism or protein glycosylation. A common defect in these disorders is the defective processing of alpha-dystroglycan.Recent advances demonstrating mutations in glycosyltransferases and dysfunction of the alpha-beta dystroglycan axis causing different forms of muscular dystrophy, especially with brain involvement, shows clearly that muscle integrity is dependent on glycosylation. We first review the newly identified muscular dystrophies, with a focus on the hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, from a clinical, biochemical and genetic standpoint, and second hereditary inclusion body myopathies caused by mutations in the gene that encodes an enzyme responsible for the protein's posttranslational modification that cause sialidation defects. It is shown very recently that molecular recognition of dystroglycan by LARGE is a key determinant in the biosynthetic pathway to produce mature and functional dystroglycan. Gene transfer of LARGE into the cells of individuals with congenital muscular dystrophies restores alpha-dystroglycan function.The clinical spectrum of congenital disorders of glycosylation is becoming increasingly broad. A demonstration of mutations in glycosyltransferases will further help to design diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches. Recent findings which show that molecular recognition by LARGE is essential for expression of functional dystroglycan and LARGE can functionally bypass alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation defects in distinct congenital muscular dystrophies, indicate a new therapeutic strategy.
