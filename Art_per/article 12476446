Date : 2003
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We describe three siblings with congenital myopathy, bullous eruption of the skin, secretory diarrhea, apparent zinc deficiency, failure to thrive, deafness, and microcephaly. The parents are not consanguineous and there are no other affected relatives. This new syndrome, which follows an apparent autosomal recessive pattern, appears to be distinct from known syndromes of secretory diarrhea, myopathy, deafness, microcephaly, and zinc deficiency.
