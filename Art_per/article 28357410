Abstract : Congenital myopathy as a nosologic entity has long been recognized, but knowledge of overall and subtype prevalence and phenotype-genotype relationship is scarce, especially in the adult population.A national cohort of 107 patients â‰¥5 years diagnosed with congenital myopathy were prospectively assessed clinically, histologically, and genetically.Twenty-five patients were excluded because of atypical features or alternative etiologies. The remaining 82 were on average 28 years old. Histologic examination revealed 14 (17%) with core disease, 15 (18%) centronuclear myopathy, 12 (15%) nemaline rods, 27 (33%) congenital fiber-type disproportion or type I predominance, and 14 (17%) nonspecific myopathic changes. Genetic etiology was identified in 46 patients (56.1%); 22.0% were heterozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in <i>RYR1</i>, 7.3% had <i>DNM2</i> mutations, and 7.3% <i>NEB</i> mutations. Less than 5% had mutations in <i>ACTA1</i>, <i>TPM2/3</i>, <i>MTM1</i>, <i>TTN</i>, <i>SEPN1</i>, or <i>SC4NA</i>. A genetic cause was established in 83% with specific histology (cores/rods/centronuclear myopathy) vs 29% with unspecific histology. The detailed clinical examination found gene-dependent discrepancies in the pattern of muscle affection and walking ability. Although walking ability was delayed in patients with <i>ACTA1</i>, <i>TPM2/3</i>, and <i>RYR1</i> mutations, it was within normal limits in patients with <i>NEB</i> and <i>DNM2</i> mutations.We found that overall, genetic and histologic prevalence of congenital myopathy in Denmark differs from previous retrospective reports. Less <i>RYR1</i> and more <i>DNM2</i> and <i>NEB</i> mutations and less core histology were present in our cohort. These differences may be explained by our prospective design, the older cohort of patients, and by differences in genetic background.
