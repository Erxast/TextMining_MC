Abstract : Centronuclear myopathy (CNM), an uncommon condition, is one of the congenital myopathies. It is believed to arise as a result of maturational arrest, with persistence of myotubes postnatally. However, denervation being the basic disease process and its possible influence on central nervous system causing defect in nuclear migration has also been postulated. Keeping in view these existing controversies, we have studied 17 cases of CNM (neonatal - 1, childhood - 13, adulthood - 3) during the last twelve and a half years. Diagnosis was based on histological and enzyme histochemical findings of muscle biopsy along with clinical data. Ultrastructural characterstics of muscle have been studied in 10 cases. The affected muscle fibres showed a central nucleus (40-99%) with perinuclear halo. Type I fibre predominance with hypoplasia was consistently seen. Fibre type disproportion was noticed in 7 cases. The neonatal form revealed dense oxidative enzyme reaction product in the centre. The morphological features of CNM were compared with foetal skeletal muscles obtained at gestational ages ranging from 9 weeks - 36 weeks (n = 18). In the severe neonatal form th myofibres resembled the foetal myotubes. In the less severe childhood and adult form of CNM, aberrant organization of cytoskeletal network might have played a pathogenetic role in causing the disease.
