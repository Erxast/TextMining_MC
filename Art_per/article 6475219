Abstract : Intermittent pressure within the limits of physiological stress and strain stimulates the growth plates of a healthy bone (Pauwels), whereas a constant pathological strong pressure does inhibit the enchondral longitudinal growth (Hueter-Volkmann). An active change of direction of growth is induced if the pressure is exerted excentrically: growth deformities. In the presence of a diseased weak bone asymmetrical pressure leads to passive bending of bone: weight bearing deformities. An attempt is made to support these distinctions by experimental and clinical observations.
