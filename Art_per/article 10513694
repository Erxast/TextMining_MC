Title : Congenital fiber type disproportion: severe form with marked improvement.
Date : 1999
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 30-month-old male exhibited marked hypotonia at birth accompanied by respiratory distress necessitating ventilator support. He subsequently demonstrated marked improvement in muscle power. He became independent of the respirator at 21 days of age and was able to sit without support at 11 months and walked alone at 24 months. Histopathologic analysis of the quadriceps femoris muscle confirmed the diagnosis of congenital fiber type of disproportion at 11 months of age. No other studies have described a patient with a severe neonatal form of congenital fiber type of disproportion who demonstrated such clear improvement. Physicians should be aware of this possibility when they interact with such patients and their families.
