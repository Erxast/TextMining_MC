Abstract : Prior to 1992, our postoperative management for congenital muscular torticollis consisted of either plaster cast immobilization or no immobilization, depending on the patient's age and the degree of contracture. However, some patients required further surgery and developed complications. In 1992, we produced rugby helmet braces for postoperative management. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical results of the previous postoperative management with the results achieved using rugby helmet braces. Twenty-five children aged younger than 6 years underwent caudal partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Twelve children aged 6 years and older underwent cranial tenotomy. These 37 patients were divided into 2 groups: no immobilization or plaster immobilization (group A; n=19) and rugby helmet braces (group B; n=18). Canale's method was used for evaluation of clinical results. In group A, the results were good in 12 patients, fair in 4, and poor in 3, whereas all 18 patients in group B had good results. Two patients in group A required further surgery, and complications were observed in 5 patients. In group B, alopecia areata was observed in 1 patient.The rugby helmet brace is easy to put on and remove, providing good retention and allowing for physiotherapy. It provides a useful method of postoperative management for congenital muscular torticollis.
