Date : 1996
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : An audit of paediatric plastic surgical procedures performed over a period of 13 years (1981-1993) at the University Teaching hospital, Lusaka, Zambia is presented. There are few publications of precise data from developing countries and no audit of this nature has been published from the area of Africa encompassed by this study. The purpose of the audit was to analyse the number and pattern of paediatric plastic surgical cases and to identify problems associated with their management. The pattern could be considered representative of the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to the audit, the basic principles of management and associated problems of some of the conditions have been outlined with particular respect to the local circumstances. It is hoped that an audit such as this will serve to upgrade the plastic surgical services and lead to the subject being incorporated into the undergraduate and postgraduate curriculums. It might also form the basis for establishing regional and provincial paediatric plastic surgical units. A balanced improvement in the provision of both general and plastic surgery within the health care services of the African continent is seen as important. Finally, this audit might enable surgeons in more developed nations to understand the pattern of disease and need in Africa and familiarise those who intend to work in the continent with the situation.
