Title : Minipolymyoclonus in congenital nemaline myopathy: a nonspecific clinical marker of neurogenic dysfunction.
Date : 1991
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors report a seven-month-old boy with severe hypotonia, poor spontaneous movements, breathing difficulties and recurrent respiratory infections, dysmorphisms and a peculiar movement disorder: minipolymyoclonus (MPM), previously reported only in spinal muscular atrophies. MPM is characterized by nonrhythmic myoclonic jerks associated with a rhythmic tremor of the extended fingers polygraphically detected. A muscle biopsy showed pathological changes typical of congenital nemaline myopathy (CNM). The relationship between MPM and CNM may be explained on the presumptive basis of the "neurogenic" nature of this congenital myopathy or by the non-specificity of this clinical sign.
