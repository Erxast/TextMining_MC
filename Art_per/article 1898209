Abstract : Fifteen children and adolescents with muscular dystrophy underwent investigation by Doppler echocardiography and high amplification electrocardiography to evaluate the quality of left ventricular function. High amplification ECG showed minor intra-atrial conduction defects in 3 cases and abnormal late micro potentials without arrhythmogenic late potentials in 3 other cases. Significant abnormalities were observed in 40% of children examined. Doppler echocardiography showed relative conservation of systolic left ventricular function but a decrease in indices of contractility was observed in 46% of cases, especially in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Abnormalities of left ventricular distensibility were observed earlier and were more common (53% of cases). A significant decrease in cardiac output was found in 50% of patients, especially among the older and more severely affected children irrespective of the type of muscular dystrophy. These two investigations provide complementary information for the evaluation of left ventricular function of children with muscular dystrophy and they are proposed routinely for the follow-up of these patients.
