Title : [Hydramnios as evidence of Steinert's congenital myotonic distrophy (author's transl)].
Date : 1980
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors describe a case of Steinert's disease. It was tracked down because of three anomalies of pregnancy: a lessening in active movements of the fetus, breech presentation and hydramnios, and it was diagnosed by neurological and electromyography of the mother. The existence of hydramnios should make it possible to avoid maternal trauma during the delivery, knowing that the child will be born with a very severe form of the illness, which is likely to be lethal. Those few cases that survive are severely mentally handicapped.
