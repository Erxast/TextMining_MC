Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A lipoma of the diaphragm is extremely rare. Although most congenital diaphragmatic lipomas are encountered in middle or old age because of their typical asymptomatic nature, none have been reported in patients younger than 14 years. We report the case of a large diaphragmatic lipoma in a 4-year-old patient.
