Abstract : The aim of this study was to describe satisfaction and quality of life (QOL) of young adults with arthrogryposis after leaving pediatric care. Twenty-three adults with arthrogryposis multiplex congenital (AMC) followed at a single pediatric orthopedic hospital (average age 23.6 years; range 18-36 years; 9 males, 14 females) completed questionnaires related to demographics, mobility, and activities of daily living. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measure Information System and Satisfaction with Life Scale were utilized to evaluate QOL and life satisfaction. Eighty-three percent reported general health as good/excellent, 30% lived independently, 69% were ambulatory in the community, and 57% were employed. QOL scores for physical function were lower, but other QOL scores were consistent with the general U.S. population. Average pain intensity was mild at 2.6 out of 10, with pain frequently reported in the legs and feet. Fifty-six percent were satisfied to extremely satisfied with life. Five individuals who were dissatisfied with life also reported lower physical function, higher anxiety, depression and fatigue, and pain in multiple joints. Although most young adults with AMC presented with mild pain and limitations in physical function; overall, they reported good QOL. Findings from the current study will help clinicians anticipate the needs of individuals with AMC as they transition from pediatric to adult care.
