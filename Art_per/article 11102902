Title : Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in myotonic dystrophies.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This review of myotonic dystrophies primarily concentrates on the clinical and genetic findings that can distinguish a novel form of myotonic dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2); proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM); and proximal myotonic dystrophy (PDM) from myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The multisystemic nature of these disorders leads to a spectrum of symptoms and signs. Careful clinical evaluation of patients with DM2/PROMM shows that the similarities among the multisystemic myotonic disorders outweigh the differences. An important point in the comparison of the phenotypes of DM1 and DM2/PROMM is that no severe congenital type of DM2/PROMM has yet been described. Genetic linkage analyses show that myotonic dystrophies can be divided into three types: the conventional Steinert type linked to chromosome 19q13.3 (DM1); DM2/PROMM and PDM linked to chromosome 3q21.3; and families not linked to either chromosomal site. Although the diagnosis may be clinically suspected, it depends on DNA analysis.
