Abstract : We report a baby girl with an antenatal diagnosis of biventricular non-compaction and complete heart block detected at 22 weeks' gestation. Postnatal echocardiography confirmed severe biventricular non-compaction hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, multiple muscular ventricular septal defects, and mild-moderate pulmonary valve stenosis. Skeletal muscle biopsy confirmed complex 1 mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency. An epicardial VVI pacemaker was implanted on day 3 of life and revised at 7 years of age. She remains stable at 8 years of age following pacing and medical treatment with carvedilol, aspirin, co-enzyme Q10, and carnitine. This represents the first report of biventricular non-compaction hypertrophic phenotype in association with congenital complete heart block and complex 1 mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in a child.
