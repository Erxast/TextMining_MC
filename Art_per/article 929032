Date : 1977
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Detailed analysis of the literature and the study of personal cases have led the authors to propose a new concept for facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy. They consider it to be a syndrome, embracing under the same clinical picture both muscular disease (classical hereditary muscular dystrophy, congenital and acquired myopathies) and neurological disease (in particular progressive pseudomyopathic amyotrophy).
