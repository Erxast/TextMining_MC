Abstract : Severe congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency at birth. Terminal outcome has been reported in infants requiring ventilation for longer than 30 days. The case is reported of an infant born at 34 weeks' gestation with severe CMD. Infant survived following ventilatory support from birth until day 67 of life. Subcutaneous erythropoietin (600 units, three times weekly) was commenced on day 6 as the Jehovah's Witness parents were strongly opposed to blood transfusions. Haemoglobin fell to 5.8 g/dL without adverse effects and then progressively rose to 15.4 g/dL. No blood transfusions were necessary. This case illustrates that infants with severe CMD requiring ventilation for more than 30 days do not have a universally fatal outcome. Low haemoglobin was well tolerated which calls for re-examination of the indications for blood transfusions in ventilated neonates.
