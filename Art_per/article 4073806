Title : Transcutaneous estimation of oxygen tension in unusual clinical situations.
Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Transcutaneous oxygen monitoring has been used successfully in the assessment of trend in tissue oxygenation in neonates and children. This study highlights the application of transcutaneous oxygen monitoring in three unusual clinical situations: dual channel oxygen monitoring in persistent foetal circulation, hyperoxia test in the differentiation of cardiac or pulmonary central cyanosis and the effect of endotracheal intubation on tissue oxygenation. Its usefulness and potential application in these situations are discussed.
