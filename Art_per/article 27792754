Abstract : SIL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor for the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, BiP. Mutations in the SIL1 gene cause Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, congenital cataracts, and myopathy. To create novel zebrafish models of MSS for therapeutic drug screening, we analyzed phenotypes in sil1 knock down fish by two different antisense oligo morpholinos. Both sil1 morphants had abnormal formation of muscle fibers and irregularity of the myosepta. Moreover, they showed smaller-sized eyes and loss of purkinje cells in cerebellar area compared to controls. Immunoblotting analysis revealed increased protein amounts of BiP, lipidated LC3, and caspase 3. These data supported that the sil1 morphants can represent mimicking phenotypes of human MSS. The sil1 morphants phenocopy the human MSS disease pathology and are a good animal model for therapeutic studies.
