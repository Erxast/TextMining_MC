Title : Recurrent congenital arthrogryposis leading to a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis in an initially asymptomatic mother.
Date : 1995
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a sibship in which the syndrome of congenital arthrogryposis occurred in two male and two female neonates, three of whom died. The mother was asymptomatic at the time of the first pregnancy and the subsequent development of muscle weakness was later confirmed to be due to myasthenia gravis. The literature on this association is briefly reviewed and the extremely high risk of recurrence of this complication in subsequent pregnancies is addressed.
