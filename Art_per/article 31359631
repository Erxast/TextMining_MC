Abstract : A pediatric registry for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) proposes to advance research by providing the platform to inform the distribution, etiology, and natural history of AMC. The registry was piloted on 40 families of children (mean = 8.25 years, 48% males) presenting with AMC across two hospitals in North America. Data on the child's demographic and newborn variables, mothers' and fathers' demographic variables, lifestyle habits, and medical history were collected using a telephone interview with the primary caregiver and review of medical charts. Mean gestational age was 38 weeks, 97% of children presented with lower extremity deformities, and 74% of neonatal interventions targeted the lower extremity. Newborns spent an average of 14 days in the hospital (range 2-56 days) mostly for diagnostic workup and feeding difficulties. Half (49%) of the sample had internal organ involvement. Genetic testing was done on 48% of the children, including chromosome studies, single gene, whole-exome/genome sequencing, and/or microarray studies. Genetic findings were inconclusive in most. Two-thirds of mothers (67%) reported inconsistently feeling fetal movements. This pilot study contributed to the refinement of participant selection, identification of data source, expansion of data sets, and areas for future exploration prior to the implementation of a multisite AMC pediatric registry.
