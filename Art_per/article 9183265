Title : The outcome of walking in stable neuromuscular deficiencies.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In some patients with stable or very gradually worsening neuromuscular disorders, walking performance nevertheless decreases with increasing hip flexion and spinal deformity as the patient grows. The relations between muscular deficiency, pelvic and spinal deformity, head stability, gravity parameters and walking performance were studied in 43 patients aged 18 months to 38 years with a view to finding out how these parameters are related, whether progressive spinal deformity and loss of walking can be avoided or delayed, and whether specific therapy for each of these parameters can help. Early combating of hip flexion deformity by physiotherapy, accompanied by limbering-up exercises of the spine to counteract lumbar and thoracic lordosis are useful, as are orthoses to correct pelvic tilt anteversion, spinal lordosis and head instability. If physiotherapy is ineffectual or too late, tenoctomy of the rectus femoris may help.
