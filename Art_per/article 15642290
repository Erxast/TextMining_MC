Abstract : The heart and mediastinal structures can be overlooked at CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). This pictorial review will demonstrate the features of cardiac disease that may be evident on a CTPA. CTPA allows assessment of not only the pulmonary arteries for embolism, but also of the bronchi, lung parenchyma, mediastinum and heart. Co-existent underlying or incidental cardiac disease is often present. Potentially life-threatening alternative diagnoses in a patient with chest symptoms can be reliably identified. Pathologies of the myocardium including hypertrophic cardio myopathy, pericardial disease, valvular disease, coronary artery disease, and intracardiac abnormalities are demonstrated pictorially. CTPA is increasingly used for the detection of pulmonary embolism. Most patients investigated have pathology other than PE as a cause of their symptoms. Frequently information about the heart is produced that provides important clues to determine the cause for the presenting symptoms and signs or reveals co-existing pathology. It is important to have a clear understanding of the features of cardiac disease which may be seen on a CTPA.
