Abstract : Skin expansion is a good solution for the reconstruction of head and neck defects. We assessed the complications of cervico-facial skin expansion technique to draft recommendations so as to minimize risks.We made a retrospective study from 1990 to 2005. Complications were analyzed according to age, sex, etiology, area to reconstruct, location of the expander, expander volume and number, simultaneous single or repeated technique, type of expander, duration of expansion, and type of flap used for reconstruction.One hundred and thirty-nine tissue expanders were placed in 114Â patients. The rate of complications was 60.4%. Age was not a risk factor (P=0.21; Fisher's exact test). The early complications were not related to the expander volume (P=0.32; Fisher's exact test). Infection was the most frequent complication (51.3%). Hypertrophic or large scars, retraction, or cording accounted for 32.4% of sequels. A rate of 6.5% of total and 6.5% of partial failure were recorded. Infection was the cause of 77.8% of total or partial failure.The complications of head and neck soft tissue expansion are often minor. The rate of reconstruction failure remains acceptable.
