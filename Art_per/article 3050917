Abstract : Failure of the neural tube to close in a fetus is one of the most devastating and yet common congenital malformations. Various organ systems including the skeletal, muscular, urologic, digestive, respiratory, skin and central nervous systems are involved. This involvement results in complicated and interrelated problems requiring services from the medical specialties of pediatrics, orthopedics, urology and neurosurgery; the allied health professions of physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, nutrition, social work and nursing; and the psychoeducational professions of education and psychology. This article attempts to summarize the information about the current needs and management techniques of children with meningomyelocele for the general pediatrician who is frequently called upon to play an important role in coordination and communication with the families and other professionals caring for these children.
