Abstract : Minimally invasive strategies can be expanded by combining standard surgical and interventional techniques. We performed a longitudinal prospective study of all pediatric patients who have undergone hybrid cardiac surgery at the University of Chicago Children's Hospital. Hybrid cardiac surgery was defined as combined catheter-based and surgical interventions in either one setting or in a planned sequential fashion within 24 hours. Between June 2000 and June 2003, 25 patients were treated with hybrid approaches. Seventeen patients with muscular ventricular septal defects (mVSDs) (mean age, 4 months; range, 2 weeks-4 years) underwent either sequential Amplatzer device closure in the catheterization laboratory followed by surgical completion (group 1A, n = 9) or one-stage intraoperative off-pump device closure (group IB, n = 8) with subsequent repair of any concomitant heart lesions. Eight patients with branch pulmonary artery (PA) stenoses (group 2) underwent intraoperative PA stenting or stent balloon dilatation along with concomitant surgical procedures. All patients survived hospitalization. Complications from the hybrid approach were mostly confined to groups 1A and 2. At a mean follow-up of 18 months, 2 group 1A patients died suddenly several months after discharge. All other patients are doing well. Hybrid pediatric cardiac surgery performed in tandem by surgeons and cardiologists is safe and effective in reducing or eliminating cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients with mVSDs who are small, have poor vascular access, or have concomitant cardiac lesions are currently treated in one setting with the perventricular approach.
