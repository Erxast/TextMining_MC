Abstract : Severe infantile Gaucher disease associated with ichthyosis and neonatal death is a rare subgroup of Type II Gaucher disease. This group of infants has little, if any, detectable beta-glucocerebrosidase activity, and prior genetic analyses have been limited in detecting the mutations responsible for this phenotype. We document an Hispanic infant succumbing with arthrogryposis and collodion membrane covering the skin who had no detectable beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in tissue samples and who was homozygous for a rare recombinant allele, RecNciI. Microscopic evaluation demonstrated accumulation of Gaucher cells in visceral organs and extensive loss of neurons in the anterior horns, brainstem, and cortex of the nervous system. The apoptosis of neuronal cells from the anterior horns and brainstem are a reasonable explanation for the arthrogryposis and neonatal death, respectively.
