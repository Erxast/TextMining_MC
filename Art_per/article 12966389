Title : Shoulder instability with absence of the long head of the biceps tendon.
Date : 2003
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We present a case of a 25-year-old woman undergoing arthroscopy for multidirectional instability. She was found to have a complete absence of the long head of the biceps tendon, thought to be congenital. It is hypothesized that the absence of the biceps may have played a role in the instability.
