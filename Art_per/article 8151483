Date : 1994
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two unrelated infants with low Apgar scores, pneumothoraces, and severe pulmonary hypertension were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation while receiving chemical sedation and neuromuscular paralysis. After decannulation from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, hypotonia and hypoventilation persisted. Neurologic evaluation confirmed that both infants had a congenital myopathy.
