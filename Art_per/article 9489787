Date : 1998
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report on 5 sibs (4 males, 1 female) with growth retardation, severe pelvic hypoplasia, arthrogrypotic changes and muscular hypotrophy of the lower limbs, and mild vertebral changes of prenatal onset. To our knowledge, this syndrome has not yet been reported. The family history suggests autosomal-recessive inheritance.
