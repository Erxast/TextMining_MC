Abstract : An 11-month-old, 8 kg girl with muscular ventricular septal defect and pulmonary valvar stenosis had successful transcatheter treatment of both anomalies. The stenotic pulmonary valve was dilated first by balloon catheter, then the VSD was approached and closed using a 6 mm Amplatzer VSD occluder device. Due to technological improvements, transcatheter techniques are more and more the procedure of choice in a larger number of congenital heart diseases in younger and younger patients.
