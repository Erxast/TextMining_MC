Abstract : Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), characterized by generalized absence of adipose tissue, has heterogeneous causes. Recently, a novel type of CGL complicated by muscular dystrophy was categorized as CGL4 caused by PTRF-CAVIN deficiency. However, it is unknown whether CGL4 exhibits clinical abnormalities during the infantile period. Here, we describe the youngest Japanese case of CGL4-a Japanese girl with asymptomatic high serum creatine kinase (CK) levels at 3months old. She was referred to our hospital at 5months of age because of her elevated serum CK (2528IU/L). Generalized absence of adipose tissue was first recognized at 2years of age. Mutation analysis of genes known to be responsible for CGL1-3 failed to disclose any abnormalities. Instead, analysis of the PTRF-CAVIN gene encoding PTRF-CAVIN revealed compound heterozygous mutations, one allele contained an insertion (c.696_697insC) and the other allele harbored a novel nonsense mutation (c.512C>A). Our patient had low serum leptin and adiponectin levels and insulin resistance. Pathological studies on biopsied muscle disclosed mild dystrophic change and highly reduced expression of PTRF-CAVIN. It was concluded that our PTRF-CAVIN deficient patient showed not only CGL but also asymptomatic elevation of serum CK because of her mild muscle dystrophic change.
