Abstract : Recently, it has been shown that in human striated muscle the signalling enzyme, brain-type nitric oxide synthase I (NOS I), is associated with the sarcolemma and complexes with dystrophin and/or members of the dystrophin complex. In order to find out whether there exists a regular association between NOS I and the complex, muscle biopsies from patients with various muscle disorders were analysed by enzyme histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. In patients suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and to a lesser extent in those with Becker-type dystrophy, NOS I and dystrophin complex components were absent or drastically reduced in the sarcolemma region. In other dystrophies, as well as in metabolic and inflammatory myopathies, NOS I and dystrophin complex constituents were expressed normally, while in the case of neurogenic diseases leading to denervation atrophy and especially congenital idiopathic clubfoot, the immunohistochemical patterns of the distribution of the dystrophin complex constituents were normal, but NOS I activity and protein were deficient or dramatically diminished. The results can be interpreted as indicating that, in general, NOS I targeting to the sarcolemma is dependent on particular members of the dystrophin complex, such as alpha-1 syntrophin, yet the expression and/or positioning of NOS I may be under the control of further factors, probably of neurogenic origin. NOS I-associated diaphorase may thus be a useful complementary tool in the diagnosis of muscle disorders.
