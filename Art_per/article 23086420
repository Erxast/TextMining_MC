Abstract : The level and turnover of phosphoinositides (PIs) are tightly controlled by a large set of PI-specific enzymes (PI kinases and phosphatases). Mammalian PI phosphatases are conserved through evolution and among this large family the dual-specificity phosphatase (PTP/DSP) are metal-independent enzymes displaying the amino acid signature Cys-X5-Arg-Thr/Ser (CX5RT/S) in their active site. Such catalytic site characterizes the myotubularin 3-phosphatases that dephosphorylate PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)Pâ‚‚ and produce PtdIns5P. Substrates of myotubularins have been implicated in endocytosis and membrane trafficking while PtdIns5P may have a role in signal transduction. As a paradox, 6 of the 14 members of the myotubularin family lack enzymatic activity and are considered as dead phosphatases. Several myotubularins have been genetically linked to human diseases: MTM1 is mutated in the congenital myopathy X-linked centronuclear or myotubular myopathy (XLCNM) and MTMR14 (JUMPY) has been linked to an autosomal form of such disease, while MTMR2 and MTMR13 are mutated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies. Furthermore, recent evidences from genetic association studies revealed that several other myotubularins could be associated to chronic disorders such as cancer and obesity, highlighting their importance for human health. Here, we discuss cellular and physiological roles of myotubularins and their implication in human diseases, and we present potential pathological mechanisms affecting specific tissues in myotubularin-associated diseases.
