Abstract : Imaging, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has in recent years increasingly become a crucial tool for the diagnostics of inherited and acquired muscular diseases. The aim of imaging in neuromuscular disorders goes beyond the detection and quantification of degenerative muscular changes, such as fatty degeneration and includes recognition of very early signs of muscular pathologies presenting as muscular edema. Therefore, imaging is a valuable diagnostic method to support the clinical diagnosis and to narrow down the differential diagnoses, leading to specific additional diagnostic tests in order to establish the correct diagnosis. Although advances in MRI hardware and technology have led to a faster, more accurate and advanced image acquisition allowing whole body examination in a feasible fashion, the standardization of image acquisition and interpretation remains a challenge. The aim of this review article is to address the important and clinically relevant issues concerning the role of imaging of neuromuscular diseases in order to facilitate a good interdisciplinary management for the diagnostics and monitoring of neuromuscular diseases.
