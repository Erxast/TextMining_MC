Title : Dental management of the chronically ill child.
Date : 1979
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Recent advances in the medical management of chronically ill children are of interest to the general dental practitioner in those areas which relate to groups of child patients frequently treated in practice. There is now a greater understanding of the effects on the child with a chronic illness or handicap of multiple visits to hospital or medical consultants, and of hospitalization for extended periods with separation from parents and family. The bearing this has on our dental management of such children is considered, as also are the recent advances in the care of children with congenital cardiac defects, haematological disorders, and neurological disturbances.
