Abstract : Congenital muscular torticollis is due to fibrosis of one or both the heads of sternocleidomastoid muscle. This may also involve the platysma, scalene muscles, and the carotid sheath and may be associated with cervical scoliosis. Conventional surgical procedures leave visible scars. Ramirez, who used the posterior part of the traditional face-lift incision, made perhaps the first attempt at concealing scars. Burstein et al. reported a large series of subcutaneous endoscopic release of torticollis through a hairline approach. Sasaki described an endoscopic two-incision, posterior auricular fold and hairline approach. A technique of transaxillary subcutaneous endoscopy for the release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in congenital muscular torticollis is described here. This procedure provides direct access to the fibrous bands, enables release without risk of damage to the spinal accessory nerve, external jugular vein, or greater auricular nerve, and leaves no visible neck scars. Two cases of congenital muscular torticollis presenting in adulthood were managed successfully by this technique. The fibrotic part of sternocleidomastoid muscle was released and the normal range of head motion was restored. There were no surgical complications encountered and the patients achieved complete pain free range of movement in six weeks. This technique provides direct and quick access, perpendicular to the line of the fibrotic bands, avoids injury to neurovascular structures and does not leave visible neck scars.
