Abstract : Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a neuromuscular disease leading to several impairments, including decrease of lower limb coordination. The Lower Extremity Motor Coordination Test (LEMOCOT) is an outcome measure recently developed for stroke population. The aim of this study was to document: 1) intra- and interrater reliability; 2) the standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change; and 3) the construct validity of the measurements obtained with the LEMOCOT in the adult ARSACS population.The LEMOCOT has shown a good intra- and interrater reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.92 to 0.97 for both dominant and non-dominant side. The construct validity (hypothesis testing) is satisfying where LEMOCOT's score negatively correlated with participants' age (r=-0.74) and the score of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (r=-0.86) and positively correlated with the balance and mobility tests (r=0.82 with the Berg Balance Scale, r=0.61 with the Six-Minute Walk Test, r=0.57 with the 10-Meter Walk Test). The LEMOCOT was also able to distinguish between patients according to disease stages.The LEMOCOT is a valid and reliable tool to assess lower limb coordination in the ARSACS population for whom the lack of coordination is a common symptom.
