Abstract : Pyomyositis is the bacterial infection of skeletal muscle, usually accompanied by abscesses. The main etiologic agent is Staphylococcus aureus. There are rare cases attributed to Streptococcus pneumoniae. This paper presents an autopsy of a four year old child with multiple congenital intramuscular hemangiomas that developed pneumococcal pyomyositis associated with meningitis. The authors propose the hypothesis that patients with hemangiomas, mainly the intramuscular type, may also represent a risk group for pyomyositis. The possibility of respiratory/meningeal co-infection, might also be considered even if the clinical picture is restricted to the muscular system.
