Abstract : Hauptmann-Thannhauser muscular dystrophy is characterized by the clinical triad of early-onset contractures of elbow, Achilles tendons, and cervical spine, slowly progressive humeroperoneal muscle wasting and weakness, and life-threatening cardiac involvement with conduction blocks manifesting in the third decade. Hauptmann-Thannhauser muscular dystrophy is due to mutations in the LMNA gene affecting the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C. We present a 16-year-old German boy with typical muscular involvement and contractures and typical course of Hauptmann-Thannhauser muscular dystrophy due to the novel missense mutation R401C. The data of this family suggest a lower penetrance of muscular and especially cardiac symptoms than expected. Autosomal-dominant Hauptmann-Thannhauser muscular dystrophy and X-chromosomal Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy are not clearly distinguishable by phenotypic criteria. Other muscular diseases associated with contractures and congenital or childhood onset are reviewed.
