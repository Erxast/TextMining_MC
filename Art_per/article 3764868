Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The incidence of congenital multiple arthrogryposis in newborn calves during the period from September 1982 to September 1983 was studied by conducting a questionnaire on 2,204 dairy farms in the province of Overijssel. This entity was observed on 19 per cent of the farms with Meuse-Rhine-IJssel breed and on 12 per cent of those with the Friesian-Dutch or Friesian-Dutch/Dutch-Friesian breed of cattle. Bull-calves showing normal or heavy birth weights following a normal period of gestation were mainly affected. There was a considerable difference in incidence between sires.
