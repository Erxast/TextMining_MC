Title : Gastroschisis and congenital contractures: coincidence or syndrome?
Date : 1981
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : An infant with a gastroschisis defect and severe congenital contractures of all extremities is presented. This case has offered dilemmas in judgement and in management as well. It is suggested that the occurrence of both these malformations in the same infant is probably not coincidental.
