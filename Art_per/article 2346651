Abstract : Increasingly, medical teams are providing sophisticated surgical treatment to pediatric patients in developing nations. Such care is often administered under relatively austere conditions using easily transported equipment. Because some of these patients may present with congenital or acquired airway abnormalities that make direct laryngoscopy difficult or impossible, alternative methods of endotracheal intubation should be available. One such technique is lightwand-guided endotracheal intubation. Use of the lightwand has a proven record of success and obviates the need for the heavier, more delicate, and more expensive flexible fiber-optic laryngoscope or pediatric bronchoscope. Two cases are reported in which pediatric patients with difficult airway anatomy due to severe burn scar contractures were successfully and easily intubated using the lightwand. This technique is useful for management of the difficult pediatric airway in the austere environment of the typical medical relief mission.
