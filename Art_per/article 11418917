Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 10-month-old child presented with a lack of extension at the distal interphalangeal joint. Despite the absence of trauma, a provisional diagnosis of mallet finger led to treatment using a short dorsal splint. Four months later the flexion had increased and included the proximal interphalangeal joint. Palpation revealed a palmar cord on the lateral aspect of the finger. Surgery disclosed a typical Dupuytren cord and the histology supported this diagnosis. There was no known family history of the disease. There was no sign of recurrence 27 months after surgery in this case of Dupuytren's disease that was present at birth.
