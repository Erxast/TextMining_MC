Abstract : A 25-year-old woman with a non-familial congenital nonprogressive myopathy was found to have atypical core-like lesions in type 1 muscle fibers. Typical core lesions (approximately 13 micrometers in diameter) and smaller, PAS positive (4.1 micrometers in diameter) atypical core were associated with a predominant type 1 fibre myopathy. A specific deficiency of fructose 1, 6-diphosphatase was found with normal values for nine other muscle glycolytic and mitochondrial marker enzymes. The data provide evidence for a specific muscle enzyme deficiency in a patient with atypical central core disease.
