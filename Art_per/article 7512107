Title : Isolated glycerol kinase deficiency in a neonate.
Date : 1994
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Glycerol kinase deficiency occurs either as a relatively benign isolated enzyme deficiency, or as part of a syndrome resulting from a microdeletion in the p21 region of the X chromosome associated with congenital adrenal hypoplasia and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Developmental delay is a consistent feature of the microdeletion syndrome but not of the isolated enzyme defect. We report a case of isolated glycerol kinase deficiency in a neonate presenting with hypotonia, apnea, mild developmental delay, and glyceroluria, without evidence of adrenal insufficiency or myopathy. A mild communicating hydrocephalus was noted on magnetic resonance imaging brain scan. It is important, therefore, to exclude glyceroluria in infants being investigated for apnea and hypotonia.
