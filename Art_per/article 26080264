Abstract : Pseudoankylosis of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is characterized by limited mouth opening and impaired mandibular mobility induced by pathologic factors outside the joint itself, usually leading to compromised speech, swallowing, and breath functions. Multiple surgical approaches or reconstructive procedures have been proposed to resolve the joint pseudoankylosis and restore the mandibular movement for these affected patients. Free forearm flap has been widely used in reconstruction for various congenital or acquired defects or deformities; however, this flap has been rarely employed for TMJ pseudoankylosis in the literature. Here, the authors reported that noma-induced TMJ pseudoankylosis was diagnosed and successfully treated by extended free forearm flap with length over 10 cm in a Chinese female patient.
