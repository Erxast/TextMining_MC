Title : Histochemistry and electron microscopy of muscle fibres in a case of congenital paramyotonia.
Date : 1976
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In a case of congenital paramyotonia a muscle biopsy was performed and studied morphologically, histochemically and ultrastructurally. A clearcut pattern of changes has been observed with ATPase and oxidative enzymes. On electron microscopy special changes known as "tubular aggregates" were found. The relationship between the two findings, as well as the significance of such alterations in the range of periodic paralyses and myotonic phenomena, are discussed.
