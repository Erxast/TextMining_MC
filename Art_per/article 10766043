Abstract : Functioning free-muscle transfer has established itself for the treatment of skeletal muscle deficiency over the last two decades. The capability of skeletal muscle to empty a spherical reservoir has been shown to be lessened if the muscle has contracted due to dissection. Currently there is no established curative treatment for bladder acontractility. Experimental data and preliminary clinical results have shown that innervated free latissimus dorsi muscle (LD) may serve as a substitute for a dysfunctional detrusor. In a clinical protocol, latissimus dorsi detrusor myoplasty (LDDM) was applied in 11 patients (age 9-68 years) with bladder acontractility due to spinal cord injury (seven patients), congenital malformations (two patients), detrusor myopathy (one patient), and idiopathic causes (one patient) who had required catheterization for bladder emptying for a minimum of 2 years. In all, 10 of 11 patients were capable of voiding volitionally, with eight of them no longer requiring catheterization, throughout the follow-up period of 12-46 months. Transplanted LD activity was confirmed by ultrasonography and flow-mode computerized tomography. It can thus be concluded that emptying of the bladder can be induced through the contractility of reinnervated free LD that has been wrapped around the bladder. An innervated free-LD flap does not undergo the severe muscle fibrosis, contracture, and atrophy that occur after transfer of completely or partially denervated pedicled muscle. Apart from the restoration of deficient detrusor function, microneurovascular transfer of a free-LD flap may be combined with tissue engineering to serve as a basis for bladder augmentation and substitution.
