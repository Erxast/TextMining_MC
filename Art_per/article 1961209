Abstract : Neuromuscular disorder can cause neonatal respiratory insufficiency. One male term newborn with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease and two preterm infants with congenital myotonic dystrophy Curshmann-Steinert-Batten are reported. Hydramnion, few spontaneous movements, prematurity, increasing respiratory insufficiency, hypotonia and myopathic facies of the mother are typical for congenital myotonic dystrophy.
