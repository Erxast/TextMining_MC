Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The clinical course and autopsy findings in a patient with fatal neonatal nemaline myopathy are described. A hypotonic infant required mechanical ventilatory support immediately following delivery and developed progressive congestive heart failure. He had mild facial dysmorphism, a high-arched palate, clinodactyly, short first metacarpals, abnormal dermatoglyphics, simian creases, and bilateral talipes varus. Light and electron microscopic study of a muscle biopsy was diagnostic of nemaline myopathy. Autopsy revealed a papillary muscle anomaly, myocardial scarring, and hepatic fibrosis. The severe clinical impairment in this infant and the unusual associated anomalies are compared with other examples of nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is a cause of respiratory insufficiency in the neonatal period.
