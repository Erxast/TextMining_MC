Abstract : Cylindrical spirals are characteristic muscular inclusions consisting of spiraling double-laminated membranes. They are found in heterogeneous clinical conditions.We obtained muscle biopsies from 2 young sisters with severe congenital hypotonia, muscle weakness, and epileptic encephalopathy, and identified cylindrical spirals.We found an association between congenital encephalomyopathy and cylindrical spirals.In this morphological and ultrastructural study, we speculate on the origin of these peculiar structures.
