Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In recent years, our understanding of the genetic foundations of incomitant strabismus has grown significantly. Much new understanding has been gleaned since the concept of congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) was introduced in 2002, and the genetic basis of CCDDs continues to be elucidated. In this review, we aim to provide an update of the genetic and clinical presentation of these disorders. Disorders reviewed include Duane syndrome (DS), HOXA1 and HOXB1 syndromes, Moebius syndrome, congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM), and horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS).
