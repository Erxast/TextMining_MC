Abstract : Poland's syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly consisting of a unilateral absence of the pectoralis major, ipsilateral muscle, hand anomaly and occasionally associated other malformations of the chest wall and breast. Many structural and functional abnormalities have been described in association with this syndrome. We report an incidentally diagnosed case in a 27-year-old male patient who presented to us with symbrachydactyly. In addition to this, anterior depression of 2nd, 3rd and 4th ribs and bifid (forked) 5th rib was present on radiological investigations. The body of sternum was short and deformed on the right side with absence of xiphoid process. All middle phalanges were absent on righthand. It is a rare variant of Poland's syndrome.
