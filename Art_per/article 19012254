Abstract : The term 'oro-motor disorders' refers to a group of diseases that predominantly affect sensory inputs, motor systems and movement organization involved in sucking, chewing, swallowing, speech articulation and facial non-verbal communication. Loss of any of the aforementioned functions results in poor social integration and significant quality of life reduction.Retrospective, observational study of 64 patients with oro-motor disorders diagnosed and followed-up at the Child Neurology Service of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital. The oro-motor disorder cause, age at the beginning of symptoms, type of feeding difficulties, type of speech disorders and other associated clinical manifestations were investigated in all patients. Changes in clinical manifestations throughout the period of follow-up in this cohort were analyzed as well.Classification of oro-motor disorders in childhood can be achieved combining the etiology and the anatomical location of the underlying disease. Four main groups can be distinguished: due to dysmorphological syndromes; secondary to bilateral perisylvian cortical dysplasias; due to brainstem dysgenesis, and secondary to congenital muscular diseases.Establishing the origin, nervous system location and pathophysiology of diseases leading to oro-motor disorders provides clues to natural history and permits anticipation in terms of treatment and care provision.
