Abstract : A two-year-old female miniature poodle died unexpectedly while romping with its owner. Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the left pulmonic sinus was discovered at necropsy. Histologically, the right ventricle was unremarkable, but multifocal to coalescing necrosis and fibrosis occurred in the myocardium and endocardium of the left ventricle. Medial hypertrophy of small muscular pulmonary arteries was observed in the lung. The cardiac lesions were similar to those of children with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk. Pulmonary hypertension, which is suggested by the pulmonary arterial medial hypertrophy, could have increased left ventricular myocardial perfusion and delayed the ischemic myocardial damage that resulted in the death of this dog.
