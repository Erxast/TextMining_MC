Abstract : Congenital myopathies (CM) are a group of rare inherited muscle disorders characterized by particular histopathological alterations on muscle biopsy. Core-rod myopathy is a CM presenting with cores and rods as distinctive muscle morphological features.We describe 3 young patients presenting congenital core-rod myopathy with bilateral foot-drop associated with autosomal recessive nebulin gene (NEB) mutations detected by exome sequencing.This report illustrates that core-rod congenital myopathy with foot-drop is frequently associated with NEB gene mutations and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset distal myopathies.
