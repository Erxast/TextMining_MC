Abstract : Muscle biopsy is still an important exam on the investigation of neuromuscular diseases although data regarding its diagnostic yield can be disappointing. We aimed to analyze the diagnostic yield of muscle biopsies in the pediatric population.We retrospectively analyzed a tertiary Neuropathology laboratory database to identify patients (<18 years old), submitted to muscle biopsy between January 2015 and August 2019. Demographics, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up were evaluated. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.One-hundred and six patients were included, 52,8% (n = 56) were male. Median age at biopsy was 6 years (IQR 10 years). Patients were divided into 8 groups, according to clinical diagnostic suspicion: mitochondrial myopathies (n = 29), congenital myopathies (n = 9), inflammatory myopathies (n = 8), muscular dystrophies (n = 7), raised CK values in serum (n = 7), metabolic myopathies (n = 5), weakness /other neuromuscular symptoms (n = 30) and multiple clinical suspicions (n = 11). Biopsy was normal in 50 patients. Of the remaining, 27 displayed specific diagnostic features, with 88,9% (n = 24) allowing a definite diagnosis: muscular dystrophies (n = 7), metabolic myopathies (n = 5), congenital myopathies (n = 4), inflammatory myopathies (n = 4), mitochondrial myopathies (n = 3) and spinal muscular atrophy (n = 1). Histology led to a change of treatment in 4 patients, all diagnosed with inflammatory myopathies. Median length of follow-up was 1 year (IQR 2 years).Biopsy diagnostic yield was 22,6%, and it was useful either in diagnostic or therapeutic approaches in 35,8%. Although advances of molecular techniques led to a decrease in muscle biopsy indications, it remains an important tool on the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases.
