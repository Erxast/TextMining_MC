Abstract : Myositis ossificans progressiva (MOP) is a rare hereditary connective tissue disorder characterized by progressive ossification of striated muscle and connective tissue associated with pain and disability. It is presumably transmitted as an autosomal dominant defect. Congenital anomalies of the hands and feet are early signs of this disease. Involvement of the spine, hips and extremities lead to the development of the "stone man" with only less than 600 cases reported in the literature. We present a case of MOP with typical muscle ossifications and skeletal malformations.
