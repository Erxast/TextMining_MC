Abstract : We investigated the hypothesis that cell membrane function is abnormal in brains of subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of human brain extracts. The total amount of choline-containing compounds was significantly higher (about three times) than in normal controls and patients with other myopathies, while N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid and creatine were within the normal range. These findings indicate that abnormal cell membrane function may be correlated with the abnormal dystrophin or lack of dystrophin in the brain of patients with DMD.
