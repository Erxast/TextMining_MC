Abstract : Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is a rare disorder, characterized by the appearance of hematopoietic elements outside of the bone marrow, which occurs in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders or congenital hemolytic anemias. We report a case with thalassemia intermedia, EMH in spinal cord and a paravertebral mass. We report the case of a 20 year old female who initially presented with back pain and leg weakness was found to have paravertebral mass in the spinal cord.
