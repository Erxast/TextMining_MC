Abstract : The loss of web space may be congenital or acquired. Although local skin flaps are usually preferred, recurrence rate is fairly high. In this study, we used the VM-plasty as a versatile technique to create a web space and expanded its applications. Thirteen patients (7 males and 6 females) with 22 syndactylous webs were operated on using this technique. The web contractures were developed on scarred tissues in 9 patients, whereas only 4 cases presented with primary congenital syndactylies. The skin graft was not used in any of the patients. All the patients gained web functions with a good esthetic appearance without any recurrence. The technique is fairly versatile and can be used both in the hand and foot for congenital complete or incomplete syndactylies and acquired web space contractures. So, we advise the VM-plasty both in primary and recurrent cases with web space loss.
