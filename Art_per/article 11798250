Abstract : A case of congenital ovarian interstitial cell hamartoma in a thoroughbred foal that died of apparent nutritional myopathy (white-muscle disease) 14 h after birth is described. An incidental finding at necropsy was a pale brown, mushroom-shaped, pedunculated mass (6 x 4 x 3 cm) attached to the left ovary. On the cut surface, the mass had a peripheral rim of dense parenchyma (3-5 mm wide), surrounding a pale gelatinous core. Histologically, the mass consisted of a peripheral zone of densely packed large cells that were quite similar, morphologically, to fetal ovarian interstitial cells, and a central area of small nests of similar cells scattered within an extremely loose connective tissue matrix. Immunohistochemically, intracytoplasmic positive labelling for inhibin was detected in these cells. These observations suggest that the lesion was an ovarian interstitial cell hamartoma.
