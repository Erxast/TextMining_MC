Abstract : The aim of the research is to study sonosemiotics of ankle joint pathology by means of ultrasound in order to optimize the diagnostic process and improve the treatment. 130 patients (age ranges from 5 to 70 years) underwent the radiological study of ankle joint medial aspect. Pathology types: degenerative-dystrophic diseases - 39 (30%), inflammatory pathology - 21 (16.2%), traumatic injuries - 20 (15.2%), vascular pathologies - 26 (20%), neurogenic problems -7 (5.4%), soft tissue neoplasms - 5 (3.8%), congenital anomalies - 7 (5.4%) and vertebral pathology - 5 (4.0%). The diagnostic studies include: a) Ultrasound, performed on digital ultrasound system using high frequency (7.5-12.0 MHz) linear probe with Doppler capability (all patients); b) X-Ray filming in antero-posterior and lateral projections (6 patients- 4.5%); c) MRI - T1 and T2 weighted images in saggital and transverse planes 10 patients (10.0%) and d) CT - 2 patients (1.5%); To 2 (1.5%) patient biopsy has been performed. This study showed that ultrasound was successful in ankle joint medial aspect pathology diagnosis in 108 cases (84.0%); It was ineffective in osseous pathology definition. In final diagnosis of impingment syndrom MRI was required in 4 (3.6%) cases. It is concluded that ultrasound should be used as a Gold Standard in diagnosis of localized pain and swelling in the ankle joint.
