Abstract : The utility of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of amelogenin gene as a reliable and rapid means of determination of sex chromosomes was tested in 20 patients of X-linked disorders (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, haemophilia and Wiscott-Aldrich and Hunter's syndromes), 12 of intersex (testicular feminization syndrome, male pseudohermaphrodites, true hermaphrodites) and 21 of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Of these, 26 (49%) cases were for prenatal diagnosis of X-linked diseases and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The presence of X and Y chromosomes was determined within 24 h of receiving the samples. The results were in conformity with cytogenetic studies in all instances. The analysis of amelogenin gene proved helpful in the diagnosis and management of these patients.
