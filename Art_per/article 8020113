Abstract : Immunohistochemical method detecting dystrophin in muscle biopsies was introduced and applied in 121 cases with a large scale of neuromuscular diseases. A monoclonal antibody NCL-DYS 2 (Novocastra) was used for the detection of C-terminal domain of dystrophin. Normal, i.e. sarcolemmal, localization of dystrophin was found in controls, in inactivity atrophy, neurogenic lesions and congenital myopathies. A similar situation except regenerating fibres was found in myositis and progressive muscular dystrophies different from Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) types, DMD cases showed a complete or nearly complete loss of sarcolemmal reaction product, whereas a partial loss of dystrophin in membrane was found in BMD cases as well as in transmitter females. Fibres splitting during neurogenic and myogenic lesions had dystrophin in newly produced sarcolemmal parts. Sarcolemmal immunoreactivity starting as early as in the 10th-12th week of gestation was found in human fetuses.
