Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a birth defect characterized by multiple joint deformities and sometimes associated with various other congenital anomalies. There have been several reported cases of miscellaneous ocular abnormalities in conjunction with this syndrome. We report the first case of congenital ophthalmoplegia as well as juvenile onset glaucoma associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. This case represented a unique therapeutic dilemma in that it was extremely difficult to surgically treat the patient's glaucoma because of her severe restrictions of ocular motility.
