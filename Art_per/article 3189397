Title : Brief clinical report: an unusual bandlike web in an infant with lethal multiple pterygium syndrome.
Date : 1988
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report on a patient with a lethal multiple pterygium syndrome who also had an unusual, bandlike web across one axilla and partial intestinal atresia. Umbilical cord wrapping with subsequent vascular compromise appears to be the most likely pathogenetic mechanism for the additional anomalies.
