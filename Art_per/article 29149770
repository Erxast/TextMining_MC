Abstract : X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), characterized by severe hypotonia, weakness, respiratory distress, and early mortality, is rare and natural history studies are few.RECENSUS is a multicenter chart review of male XLMTM patients characterizing disease burden and unmet medical needs. Data were collected between September 2014 and June 2016.Analysis included 112 patients at six clinical sites. Most recent patient age recorded was ≤18 months for 40 patients and >18 months for 72 patients. Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 3.7 (3.7) months and 54.3 (77.1) months, respectively. Mortality was 44% (64% ≤18 months; 32% >18 months). Premature delivery occurred in 34/110 (31%) births. Nearly all patients (90%) required respiratory support at birth. In the first year of life, patients underwent an average of 3.7 surgeries and spent 35% of the year in the hospital.XLMTM is associated with high mortality, disease burden, and healthcare utilization.
