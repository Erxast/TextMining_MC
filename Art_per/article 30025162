Abstract : Mutations in the EXOSC3 gene are responsible for type 1 pontocerebellar hypoplasia, an autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by cerebellar atrophy, developmental delay, and anterior horn motor neuron degeneration. Muscle biopsies of these patients often show characteristics resembling classic spinal muscle atrophy, but to date, no distinct features have been identified.Clinical data and muscle biopsy findings of 3 unrelated patients with EXOSC3 mutations are described.All patients presented as a severe congenital cognitive and neuromuscular phenotype with short survival, harboring the same point mutation (c.92G>C; p.Gly31Ala). Muscle biopsies consistently showed variable degrees of sarcomeric disorganization with myofibrillar remnants, Z-line thickening, and small nemaline bodies.In this uniform genetic cohort of patients with EXOSC3 mutations, sarcomeric disruption and rod structures were prominent features of muscle biopsies. In the context of neonatal hypotonia, ultrastructural studies might provide early clues for the diagnosis of EXOSC3-related pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Muscle Nerve 59:137-141, 2019.
