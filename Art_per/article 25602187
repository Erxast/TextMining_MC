Abstract : The autosomal-dominant myotonic dystrophies dystrophia myotonica type-1 (DM1, Curschmann-Steinert disease) and dystrophia myotonica type-2 (DM2, proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM)), are, contrary to the non-dystrophic myotonias, progressive multisystem disorders. DM1 and DM2 are the most frequent of the muscular dystrophies. In both diseases the skeletal muscle is the most severely affected organ (weakness, wasting, myotonia, myalgia). Additionally, they manifest in the eye, heart, brain, endocrine glands, gastrointestinal tract, skin, skeleton, and peripheral nerves. Phenotypes of DM1 may be classified as congenital, juvenile, classical, or late onset. DM2 is a disorder of the middle or older age and usually has a milder course compared to DM1. DM1 is due to a CTG-repeat expansion > 50 repeats in the non-coding 3' UTR of the DMPK-gene. DM2 is caused by a CCTG-repeat expansion to 75 - 11 000 repeats in intron-1 of the CNBP/ZNF9 gene. Mutant pre-mRNAs of both genes aggregate within the nucleus (nuclear foci), which sequester RNA-binding proteins and result in an abnormal protein expression via alternative splicing in downstream effector genes (toxic RNA diseases). Other mechanisms seem to play an additional pathogenetic role. Clinical severity of DM1 increases from generation to generation (anticipation). The higher the repeat expansion the more severe the DM1 phenotype. In DM2 severity of symptoms and age at onset do not correlate with the expansion size. Contrary to DM2, there is a congenital form and anticipation in DM1.
