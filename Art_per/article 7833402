Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Midline clefts of the lower lip, mandible, tongue, and neck are rare congenital deformities and are classified as facial cleft no. 30 by Tessier. This is a report of a patient who presented with congenital fibrotic neck cord but no lower lip cleft, which has been the most frequently observed pathognomonic sign of this anomaly. The patient was treated initially for thyroglossal remnant. In the patients who present with a fibrotic cord located at the cervical midline without a lower lip cleft, the diagnosis of facial cleft no. 30 should be kept in mind.
