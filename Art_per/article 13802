Abstract : Data concerning muscular biopsies (histochemically examined) of three patients affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, neurogenic atrophy of spondilosic origin and benign congenital hypotonia, are described. The common finding was a histochemical appearence of "type predominance". This point and the possible "neurogenic" origin of benign congenital hypotonia, are discussed.
