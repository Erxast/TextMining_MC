Abstract : The purpose of this study was to compare histologic characteristics of congenital nemaline myopathy (CNM), adult-onset nemaline myopathy (AONM), and human immunodeficiency virus-associated adult-onset nemaline myopathy (HAONM). There was no difference between the pathology of CNM and AONM; however, HAONM had distinctive pathologic features by light microscopy. The fibers in HAONM showed marked intrasarcoplasmic changes, including small vacuoles and granular degeneration.
