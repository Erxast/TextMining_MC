Abstract : Laminopathies are a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders caused by mutations in the <i>LMNA</i> gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamins A and C. The most frequent diseases associated with <i>LMNA</i> mutations are characterized by skeletal and cardiac involvement, and include autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B, and <i>LMNA</i>-related congenital muscular dystrophy (<i>LMNA</i>-CMD). Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for <i>LMNA</i>-CMD are not yet understood, severe contracture and muscle atrophy suggest that mutations may impair skeletal muscle growth. Using human muscle stem cells (MuSCs) carrying <i>LMNA</i>-CMD mutations, we observe impaired myogenic fusion with disorganized cadherin/Î² catenin adhesion complexes. We show that skeletal muscle from <i>Lmna</i>-CMD mice is unable to hypertrophy in response to functional overload, due to defective fusion of activated MuSCs, defective protein synthesis and defective remodeling of the neuromuscular junction. Moreover, stretched myotubes and overloaded muscle fibers with <i>LMNA</i>-CMD mutations display aberrant mechanical regulation of the yes-associated protein (YAP). We also observe defects in MuSC activation and YAP signaling in muscle biopsies from <i>LMNA</i>-CMD patients. These phenotypes are not recapitulated in closely related but less severe EDMD models. In conclusion, combining studies in vitro, in vivo, and patient samples, we find that <i>LMNA</i>-CMD mutations interfere with mechanosignaling pathways in skeletal muscle, implicating A-type lamins in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth.
