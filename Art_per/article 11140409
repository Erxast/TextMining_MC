Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a very rare disease characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes and progressive heterotopic ossification of muscles. To identify the chromosomal localization of the FOP gene, we conducted a genomewide linkage analysis using seven affected families. The FOP phenotype is linked to markers located in the 17q21-22 region (LOD score of 3.41 at the recombination fraction theta = 0). Crossover events localize the putative FOP gene within a 12cM interval, bordered proximally by D17S809 and distally by D17S1838. Noggin (NOG) gene, located in 17q22, is an excellent candidate gene for FOP.
