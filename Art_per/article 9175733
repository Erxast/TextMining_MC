Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy is characterised by the striking level of somatic heterogeneity seen between and within tissues of the same patient, which probably accounts for a significant proportion of the pleiotropy associated with this disorder. The congenital form of the disease is associated with the largest (CTG)n repeat expansions. We have investigated the timing of instability of myotonic dystrophy (CTG)n repeats in a series of congenitally affected fetuses and neonates. We find that during the first trimester the repeat is apparently stable and that instability only becomes detectable during the second and third trimesters. In our series repeat instability is apparent only after 13 weeks gestational age and before 16 weeks. The appearance of heterogeneity shows some tissue specificity, with heart most commonly having the largest expansion. The degree of heterogeneity is not correlated with initial expansion size as gauged by chorionic villus and blood (CTG)n repeat sizes.
