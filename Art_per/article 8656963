Title : Orbicularis oris muscle injury in brass players.
Date : 1996
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The embouchure of the brass player is critical to tone production and largely depends on the integrity of the orbicularis oris muscle. Injury to this muscle can cripple the professional musician by causing fatigue, pain, and tonal deterioration. Ten brass players presented with muscular defects in the orbicularis oris muscle. Examination identified areas of abnormality within the muscle and electromyography (EMG) ruled out a neurologic deficit. All patients underwent exploration under neuroleptic anesthesia, and 9 patients underwent repair. The technique is described. The repaired patients reported improvement after the operation and all resumed playing at their premorbid level. The 10th patient was found to have thinning of the entire orbicularis oris muscle (presumably congenital) and was not able to be repaired. There were no complications of the procedure and no recurrences.
