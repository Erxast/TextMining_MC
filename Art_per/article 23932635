Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Peliosis hepatis (PH) is a rare condition characterized by multiple blood-filled spaces within the hepatic parenchyma that can lead to fatal hemorrhage. There is no consensus on the best treatment algorithm for PH, and therapy is directed at removing the potential causative agent with operative intervention when necessary. Here we present the first known case of PH in a child with myotubular myopathy who was successfully treated with angiography and hepatic artery embolization as a first line therapy, without the need for operative intervention. Awareness of this condition and the available treatment modalities may lead to favorable outcomes in future cases.
