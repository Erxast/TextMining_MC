Abstract : Data of histological and histochemical examinations of 85 biopsy specimens of muscular tissue taken from patients with hereditary muscular and neuromuscular diseases are presented. The diseases were: the extremity-and-lumbar form of myopathy congenital myopathies, Charcot-Marie's neural amyotrophy, Steinert-Batten's atrophic myotonia, and other rare muscular diseases.
