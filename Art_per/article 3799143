Abstract : The clinical and morphological features of a congenital myopathy in a young male golden retriever dog were studied. Muscle biopsies at 4 and 8 months of age were examined with light and electron microscopy. Clinical features included early onset of generalized muscle weakness with selective muscle atrophy and hypertrophy, splaying of the limbs, stiff gait, and marked elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK). An electromyograph revealed spontaneous electrical activity characterized by sustained high-frequency activity, which was not abolished by neuromuscular blockade. Morphologically there was marked hypercontraction and segmental necrosis of muscle fibers with phagocytosis and regeneration. Ultrastructurally, dilatation of sarcoplasmic reticulum was the most consistent feature associated with early fiber degeneration. No abnormalities were noted in the central or peripheral nervous system. Progression of the disease was evident at 8 months. It was concluded that the findings are consistent with a dystrophic process of primary muscle origin. The probable genetics and comparison to other animal models of muscular dystrophy and to Duchenne dystrophy are discussed.
