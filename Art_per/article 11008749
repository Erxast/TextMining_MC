Abstract : Forty-six patients (25 male and 21 female) with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita who were seen at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children between the years 1940 and 1997 were evaluated to assess the prevalence and patterns of scoliosis and the long-term results after both nonsurgical and surgical treatment methods. We found the prevalence of scoliosis to be 65.9% (32 of 46 patients). A single thoracolumbar curve was the predominant curve pattern. No congenital curve types or vertebral anomalies were seen in our group of patients. In the nonsurgical group, the mean curve was <30 degrees at follow-up. In the surgical group, the mean primary curve before spinal arthrodesis was 78.5 degrees. Three patients in the surgical group who were nonambulators have become household ambulators at the most recent follow-up. We recommend bracing in patients who are ambulators and have a curve of <30 degrees. Combined anterior and posterior spinal arthrodesis gave the best results.
