Date : 1989
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case of true temporomandibular ankylosis surgically treated at 8 months is presented. A thorough review of the literature suggests that this is one of the few cases of truly congenital temporomandibular ankylosis to be reported. After an introductory note on aetiopathogenesis and a discussion of associated malformations, it is concluded that the case may represent an atypical form of Franceschetti's syndrome.
