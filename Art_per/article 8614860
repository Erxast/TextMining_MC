Date : 1995
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Herniation of the left peroneus longus muscle was present in three male members of the same family, being the first reported case of this condition in a familial setting. The hernias were differentiated from other mass lesions and varices by magnetic resonance imaging. The images demonstrated a fascial defect originating in the area where vessels and nerves penetrate the fascia, suggesting that the three men had a congenital weakness in the fascia.
