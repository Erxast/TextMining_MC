Abstract : Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by a marked weakness, generalized hypotonia, joint contractures and a muscle biopsy suggestive of dystrophic changes. The aim of this study has been to assess the prevalence of heart involvement in merosin-positive CMD patients examined by echocardiography and Doppler.A total of 10 merosin-positive CMD patients and 100 healthy children were evaluated by echocardiography and Doppler examinations and the results were compared.Three out of 10 patients showed a reduction of the ejection fraction and of the shortening fraction; in 1 case, a dilatation of left ventricular diastolic diameter was observed.In the 10 patients examined by echocardiography and Doppler, a heart involvement has been observed in 25% of cases.
