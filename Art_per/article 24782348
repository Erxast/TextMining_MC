Abstract : LBX1 plays a cardinal role in neuronal and muscular development in animal models. Its function in humans is unknown; it has been reported as a candidate gene for idiopathic scoliosis. Our goal is to document the first clinical case of a microduplication at 10q24.31 (chr10:102927883-103053612, hg19), affecting exclusively LBX1. The patient, a 12-year-old girl, showed attention problems, dyspraxia, idiopathic congenital scoliosis, and marked hypotrophy of paravertebral muscles. Her paternal aunt had a severe and progressive myopathy with a genetic study that revealed the same duplication. We propose to consider genetic studies, particularly of LBX1, in patients with scoliosis and/or hypotrophy-hypoplasia of paravertebral muscles of unknown etiology.
