Abstract : Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1), myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7), and selenoprotein N1 (SEPN1) mutations are associated with core myopathies. RYR1 mutations cause most cases of central core disease (CCD).We screened 8 Chinese patients with clinicopathological diagnosis of CCD. Genetic analysis was carried out by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify causative genes. Variants were assessed for pathogenicity using bioinformatic approaches, and NGS results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.One novel (p.L4578V) and heterozygous missense mutations in RYR1 were identified in 7 patients. Two patients carried a novel mutation, 1 had p.M4640R, 3 had p.R4861H, and 1 had p.R4861C. All patients had mild to moderate severity phenotypes. Histopathological findings demonstrated central cores and type I fiber predominance.NGS is an efficient strategy to identify variants in RYR1 in CCD. However, genetic results revealed by NGS must be combined with clinicopathologic features to validate the diagnosis. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54: 432-438, 2016.
