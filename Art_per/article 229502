Abstract : Seventeen new-born piglets of hybrid stock were tested for defects of neuromuscular transmission by stimulation electromyography (EMG). Nine of these displayed extreme symptoms of muscle weakness (splayleg), while the others were their clinically normal littermates. Muscles from four different functional groups were investigated, including the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, knee flexors and thigh adductors. Repetitive stimulation of muscle nerves at 3 Hz gave comparable peak-to-peak amplitudes of the EMG response in splayleg and control piglets (mean values from 5 to 10 mV). The lowest mean EMG response values at this stimulation frequency were found in splayleg adductor muscles of the thigh which were not, however significantly different from the controls. Higher frequencies of stimulation (30, 50 and 100 Hz), in general, led to a less pronounced decrease of EMG amplitude in splayleg piglet muscles than in the controls, with the exception of knee flexors. Neither splayleg nor control muscles exhibited post-activation exhaustion or post-tetanic potentiation. It is being concluded from these results that congenital myofibrillar hypoplasia is not primarily a myasthenia-like syndrome, but that either excitation-contraction coupling or the contractile mechanism itself are primarily affected.
