Abstract : Data on 4,411 male and 4,148 female progeny from the University of Missouri-Columbia swine research herd were analyzed to evaluate the associations of sire, breed, weight at birth, and sex of the pigs with the development of congenital splayleg. Statistically significant differences in frequency of splayleg were found among sires and among breeds indicating a genetic influence. Differences in frequencies among male vs female progeny also were found to be statistically significant. The overall frequency among male progeny was 1.74 times that observed among female progeny. Comparison of birth weights of splayleg vs normal pigs showed birth weights to be statistically significantly smaller among affected pigs.
