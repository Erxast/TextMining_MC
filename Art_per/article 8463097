Title : [Camptodactyly. The syndrome of flexion contracture of the fingers].
Date : 1993
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report on three cases of a nonpainful flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the little finger. The word camptodactyly means bent finger, and the condition can occur either as an inherited or as a sporadic disorder. Simple camptodactyly should be borne in mind in the differential diagnosis of Dupuytren's contractures, other nontraumatic contractures of the fingers, and sclerodermia.
