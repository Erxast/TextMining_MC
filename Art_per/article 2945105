Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : An apparently inherited myopathy, characterized by the presence of large numbers of nemaline rods in skeletal muscle fibers, was investigated in five cats. Onset of signs varied from 6 months to 1.5 years of age and consisted of reluctance to move, jerky gait and muscle twitching, hyporeflexia, and muscle wasting, which was most prominent in the proximal muscles of the forelimbs. All of the cats, three males and two females, were from the same dam. In addition to the presence of rods, the myopathy was characterized by marked fiber size variation, with atrophy of type 1 and type 2a muscle fibers. In addition, there was infolding of the sarcolemma and fiber splitting. Ultrastructurally, the rods closely resembled those described in human nemaline myopathy.
