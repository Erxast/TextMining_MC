Title : Central core disease. Study of a family with five affected generations.
Date : 1982
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A family is described in which at least 37 members in five generations living in Australia have suffered from a rare congenital myopathy--central core disease (CCD). Histochemical and ultrastructural features typical of CCD were present on muscle biopsy. Although there are variations in clinical expression, a relatively benign and nonprogressive course is usual. Inheritance of CCD in this family conforms to an autosomal dominant pattern with a high degree of penetrance.
