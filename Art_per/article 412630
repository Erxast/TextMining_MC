Abstract : The cytogenetic analysis of an infant with multiple congenital anomalies revealed a small deletion of the long arm of one No. 11 chromosome: 46,XX,del(11)(q23). The main clinical manifestations included: ocular colobomata, absent philtrum, severe congenital heart disease, contractures of the large joints and skin pigmentation. Both parents showed a normal chromosome constitution. In comparison to the previously reported cases of 11q-, the patient presented here had more severe congenital anomalies. The correlation of the size of the deletion, and the location of the break, with the physical findings is discussed.
