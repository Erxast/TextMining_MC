Abstract : Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome is a rare, genetically determined autosomal recessive disorder, characterised by the presence of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of multiple tissues of the body, particularly in the blood leukocytes and congenital non-bullous icthyosiform erythroderma. In this paper, we report one-year child who presented with skin lesions since birth and hepatomegaly. Liver biopsy showed steatohepatitis; and peripheral blood smear confirmed Jordan`s anomaly, which is a permanent feature of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome.
