Abstract : Selenoprotein N (SEPN1) is a type II glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that senses calcium levels to tune the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA pump) through a redox-mediated mechanism, modulating ER calcium homeostasis. In SEPN1-depleted muscles, altered ER calcium homeostasis triggers ER stress, which induces CHOP-mediated malfunction, altering excitation-contraction coupling. SEPN1 is localized in a region of the ER where the latter is in close contact with mitochondria, i.e., the mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM), which are important for calcium mobilization from the ER to mitochondria. Accordingly, SEPN1-depleted models have impairment of both ER and mitochondria calcium regulation and ATP production. SEPN1-related myopathy (SEPN1-RM) is an inherited congenital muscle disease due to SEPN1 loss of function, whose main histopathological features are minicores, i.e., areas of mitochondria depletion and sarcomere disorganization in muscle fibers. SEPN1-RM presents with weakness involving predominantly axial and diaphragmatic muscles. Since there is currently no disease-modifying drug to treat this myopathy, analysis of SEPN1 function in parallel with that of the muscle phenotype in SEPN1 loss of function models should help in understanding the pathogenic basis of the disease and possibly point to novel drugs for therapy. The present essay recapitulates the novel biological findings on SEPN1 and how these reconcile with the muscle and bioenergetics phenotype of SEPN1-related myopathy.
