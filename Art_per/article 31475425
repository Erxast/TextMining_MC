Abstract : Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome (PS), an exceedingly rare mitochondrial disorder, involves multiple systems including hematologic system and pancreas. Other mitochondrial disorders have been associated with progressive infrahisian block but this has not yet been described as a major feature of PS. We report a 7-year-old girl with classical features of PS and cardiac conduction defect. Her electrocardiogram revealed QRS prolongation with right bundle and left anterior fascicular blocks. Follow-up Holter revealed bifascicular block, alternating left and right bundle branch blocks, supraventricular tachycardia (with alternating bundles), and suspicion for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She underwent successful transvenous single-chamber ventricular pacemaker.
