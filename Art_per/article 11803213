Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a general term for congenital multiple joint contractures, the aetiology of which is variable. Prenatal diagnosis is usually based on the detection of diminished fetal movements and joint contractures on ultrasound. There are also reports of early diagnosis of arthrogryposis in the first and early second trimester by detection of subcutaneous oedema. We report another case of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita with increased nuchal translucency and scoliosis diagnosed by ultrasonography at 15 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy was terminated at the request of the parents. Post-mortem examination revealed that it was not associated with fetal myopathy or neuropathy. Multiple joint contractures with increased nuchal translucency without any underlying fetal neurogenic and myogenic pathology may be a distinct form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.
