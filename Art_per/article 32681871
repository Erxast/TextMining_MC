Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Chronic wounds often are the result of bone deformities, compounded by musculotendinous and ligamentous imbalance. Sensory neuropathy places patients at greater risk for acute wounds to develop into chronic wounds. Etiologies of these deforming forces include Charcot neuroarthropathy, trauma, and congenital and acquired neuromuscular disorders. Management of these deformities ranges from simple relief of pressure with soft inserts to bracing for mechanical instability. Correction of more complex deformities requires resection of bone, osteotomies, fusions, and external fixation. Tendon and ligament imbalance must be addressed at all levels of deformity. Postoperatively, patients must be re-evaluated for continuation of orthoses and bracing.
