Title : Syndrome of mental retardation and distal arthrogryposis in sibs.
Date : 1991
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two sisters presented with a syndrome of characteristic facial anomalies and distal arthrogryposis. The older sister is now 4 years old and is severely mentally retarded. Her sister died of respiratory failure due to hypoplastic lungs shortly after birth. The occurrence of this potentially lethal syndrome in 2 sisters with unaffected parents suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.
