Abstract : The mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA). Patients with this syndrome may present to the otolaryngologist with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which is genetic in origin. A high index of suspicion is required because this hearing loss is part of a syndrome for which early diagnosis and intervention is required.
