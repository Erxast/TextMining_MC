Abstract : Toxic myopathies are an uncommon manifestation of chemotherapeutic agents. Most myopathies are characterized by a weakness affecting proximal limb-muscles more than distal ones. Steroids, chloroquine and ipecac syrup are the most common drugs inducing myopathies. Toxic myositis is rare and reported with D-penicillamine abuse. Myotoxicity of local agents injection such as anesthetics, steroids or antibiotics is also known. Congenital myopathies such as malignant hyperthermia, hypokalemic periodic paralysis or paroxysmal myoglobinuria may also be induced by drugs but are very rare.
