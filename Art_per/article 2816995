Abstract : A patient with distal arthrogryposis, congenital dislocations of the hips, a prominent forehead, epicanthal folds, thin lips, and a poorly defined philtrum was found to have a deletion of 15q and a duplication of 16q. Her mother, maternal grandmother, and great grandmother had a balanced t(15q-, 16q+). The gene for adenine phosphoribosyl transferase was assignable to the 16q22----16qter area that was duplicated.
