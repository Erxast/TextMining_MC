Title : Neuromuscular arthrogryposis multiplex congenita in a thoroughbred foal.
Date : 1984
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita was studied in a newborn thoroughbred foal. The syndrome affected only the left hind limb allowing the right hind limb to serve as a reference. There was a significant depletion of large motor neurons from the ventral horn of the spinal cord from L3 to S4 on the affected side. Hypoplasia of nerves, muscles, and bones was present in the affected limb. Histologically, hypoplasia and degeneration of myofibers and nerve bundles were seen. No cause of the syndrome, which corresponds to most human cases, was determined. Neuromuscular arthrogryposis was diagnosed because of the difficulty in distinguishing primary neuropathic from primary myopathic forms of the disease.
