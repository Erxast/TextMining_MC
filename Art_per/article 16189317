Abstract : In five children, six forearms with a fixed pronation deformity secondary to congenital radioulnar synostosis were treated by a derotation osteotomy of the distal radius and the midshaft of the ulna. There were three boys and two girls with a mean age of 4.9 years (3.5 to 8.25) who were followed up for a mean of 29 months (18 to 43). The position of the forearm was improved from a mean pronation deformity of 68 degrees (40 degrees to 80 degrees ) to a pre-planned position of 10 degrees of supination in all cases. Bony union was achieved by 6.3 weeks with no loss of correction. There was one major complication involving a distal radial osteotomy which required exploration for a possible compartment syndrome.
