Abstract : Variants in the SLC25A1 gene are associated with a severe neurometabolic disease, D-2- and L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D/L-2-HGA). A report in 2014 presented the first account of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) with mild intellectual disability (ID) caused by SLC25A1. To date, only two missense variants in SLC25A1 have been linked to CMS.A Chinese boy presented fatigable muscular weakness, myasthenic crisis, epilepsy and developmental delay along with mild elevation of urinary 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG) and lactic acid levels. He showed a partial response to pyridostigmine. Genetic analysis using trio whole-exome sequencing (WES), Sanger sequencing, and cosegregation analyses revealed two novel pathogenic variants of SLC25A1 (c.628C > T, p.R210X; c.145G > A, p.V49M).We report a boy who carries novel compound heterozygous variants of SLC25A1 and presents a phenotype intermediate between CMS and D/L-2-HGA. This case expands the range of known phenotypes and genotypes associated with SLC25A1.
