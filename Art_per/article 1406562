Date : 1992
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case report is presented in which tissue expansion is used to provide the additional skin needed during an opening wedge mid-foot osteotomy to correct a varus foot deformity in a patient with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Tissue expansion is a relatively new method of acquiring coverage for wounds which may have advantages over previous techniques. The risks and drawbacks of this technique will be described in detail.
