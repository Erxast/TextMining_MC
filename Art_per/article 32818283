Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita involves stiff contracture of joints and weak atrophic muscles presenting at birth. The two most common forms are amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposis. Amyoplasia affects all 4 extremities: internally rotated shoulders, extended fixed elbows, flexed fixed wrists, extended fixed knees, clubfeet, and decreased muscle volume. Distal arthrogryposis is a group of syndromes with a genetic basis. The distal joints are contracted. Clubfeet and congenital vertical talus are the most common foot deformities. A 10-year-old boy presented with distal arthrogryposis with bilateral congenital tali. He reported having deformed and painful feet and difficulty wearing shoes. His rocker-bottom foot deformities caused him to walk with a heel to heel gait. He also had stiff extended knees. His previous foot surgeries included failed open reduction and pin fixation of the talonavicular joints with Achilles tendon lengthening and capsulotomies. The boy underwent bilateral talectomies and releases of contracted joint capsules and lengthening of multiple extrinsic tendons through separate incisions. The talectomy of each foot was performed via a novel medial surgical approach. At 2-year follow-up, he had normal-appearing plantar grade feet. He had a painless gait, could ambulate independently, and was considered to have an excellent result. This is the first detailed report of performing a talectomy via a medial approach for bilateral congenital tali in a patient with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.
