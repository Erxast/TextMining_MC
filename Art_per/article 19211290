Abstract : The authors report the case of a child presenting with bilateral upper limb arthrogryposis due to agenesis of the biceps. Physical examination revealed a bilateral deficit of active elbow flexion although passive flexion was possible. Echography confirmed bilateral biceps agenesis. The treatment was surgical, one side at a time. An ipsilateral pedicle latissimus dorsi muscle transfer was used to restore elbow function. The second procedure took place 7 months after the first. After each operation, the patient's limb was immobilised in plaster for 6 weeks before rehabilitation was commenced. Six months postoperatively, elbow flexion measured 100 degrees on both sides. The functional sequelae at the donor site were negligible, apart from some persisting hypertrophic scars. Bilateral biceps brachii agenesis has not previously been reported in the literature. The surgical treatment undertaken enabled restoration of function with minimal sequelae.
