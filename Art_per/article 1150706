Date : 1975
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Central core disease is a congenital, non-progessive myopathy with proximal muscle weakness most prevalent about the pelvic girdle. Including out two patients  there have been seven recorded cases of congenital hip dislocation associated with central core disease in children. Initial and recurrent contractures about the hip and knee should suggest the possibility of central core disease. However, the definitive diagnosis can only be made by muscle biopsy.
