Date : 2003
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 13-hour-old Aberdeen-Angus was involuntarily recumbent since birth. Congenital nutritional muscular dystrophy was suspected based on clinical findings, increased serum creatine kinase, and decreased serum vitamin E and selenium levels. Recovery followed after supportive therapy and parenteral vitamin E and selenium. Reports of this disease in newborn calves are unusual.
