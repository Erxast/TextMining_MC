Abstract : Statins are contraindicated in patients with myopathies. Until a few years ago, in those patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia who also presented muscular dystrophies and did≈Ñt reach adequate cholesterol plasmatic levels, the next therapeutic ladder was lipoapheresis. When iPCSK9 first appeared, lipoapheresis could be suspended in some of these patients, sustaining nevertheless proper levels of cholesterol. We present the case of a 27 year-old male, diagnosed with Congenital Muscular Dystrophy in the early childhood. He was referred to the Unit of Lipidology presenting hypercholesterolemia which, after genetic test, was assessed as Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Despite of treatment with diet and ezetimibe, cLDL blood levels abide high, being consequently included in lipoapheresis programme, therewith obtained levels of cLDL of 70mg/dl. In providing iPCSK9, lipoapheresis was withdrawn and treatment with alirocumab 150mg fortnightly introduced, unveiling a positive response, and sustaining cLDL levels around 75mg/dl.
