Abstract : Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) or Beals-Hecht syndrome (BHS) presents a very rare connective tissue disorder characterized by narrow body habitus, crumpled ears, arachnodactyly, contractures, and scoliosis. In our case report, the physical examination revealed typical physical findings to determine the physical diagnosis of BHS in contrast to negative finding on DNA analysis. From clinical point-of-view, it is important to include a complex clinical approach in making the diagnosis.
