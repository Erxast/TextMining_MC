Title : Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG): update and new developments.
Date : 2004
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : After a brief overview on CDG, this workshop concentrated on the experience with (mostly) known CDG in a European country (the Czech Republic) and on the Australasian experience, on recent developments regarding congenital muscular dystrophies due to O-mannoslyglycan assembly defects, and on new presentations of CDG. It was concluded that we are still at the beginning of 'explosive' research on CDG and that we need to apply new and known technologies to the diagnosis, understanding of pathophysiology, and treatment of CDG.
