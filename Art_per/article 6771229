Title : Teratological hip dislocation.
Date : 1980
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The hallmark of teratological congenital hip dislocation is its advanced severity at birth, signifying longer antenatal duration and accentuation of distortion. There may be contributions from a multiplicity of unrelated syndromes, such as local intrauterine factors, failure of proper formations early in the embryonic period, or genetically determined disorders. Treatment is generally difficult and the end result is uncertain.
