Abstract : We report on clinical evaluations of Brazilian patients with misoprostol-induced arthrogryposis. All 15 patients had growth retardation, underdeveloped bones, short feet with equinovarus, rigidity of several joints with skin dimples and webs, decreased movement of legs stemming from neurologic impairment, bilateral symmetrical hypoplasia or atrophy of limb muscles, and absent tendon reflexes. Of the 15 patients, five had upper limb deformities in addition to lower limb involvement, and one had spinal cord disruption leading secondarily to segmental sensory loss and neurogenic bladder and bowel. Electroneuromyography of five patients indicated that the abnormalities were of neurogenic origin and suggestive of anterior horn cell defects. All of their mothers took 400-4,800 mcg of misoprostol orally or vaginally at 8 to 12 weeks of pregnancy. Our observations support a previously stated caution with regard to the embryotoxicity of misoprostol.
