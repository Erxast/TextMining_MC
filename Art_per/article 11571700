Abstract : At the age of five years a male child started to develop a progressive rigid spine, torsion scoliosis, and flexion contractures of his elbows, knees, hips, and ankles owing to severe proximal and distal muscle weakness. He had three muscle biopsies from three different muscles at ages 7, 11, and 14 years, respectively. Myopathologically, these muscle tissues contained numerous inclusions which, at the ultrastructural level, turned out to be reducing bodies and cytoplasmic bodies, often in close spatial proximity. Similar histological inclusions, although not further identified by histochemistry and electron microscopy, were seen in his maternal grandmother's biopsied muscle tissue who had developed weakness of the legs and hands after the age of 50 years. The patient's parents were healthy, but the mother's quadriceps muscle showed an increased spectrum of muscle fibre diameters. Our patient, thus, had a neuromuscular disorder, perhaps familial, presenting as a mixed congenital myopathy, i.e., reducing body myopathy with cytoplasmic bodies, of which the morphological lesions could be consistently documented over several years in his different limb muscles. While other mixed congenital myopathies had shown cores and rods, both related to sarcomeres and thus possibly morphogenetically related, cytoplasmic bodies thought to be related to Z-bands and reducing bodies dissimilar to any muscle fibre constituent do not share any common denominator. Therefore, we suggest that this neuromuscular disorder may be a unique mixed congenital myopathy, either sporadic or genetic. In the latter case, the transmission pattern suggested X-linked recessive inheritance, but an autosomal-dominant transmission with variable penetrance could not be ruled out.
