Abstract : To explore the genetic etiology of two pedigrees affected with congenital arthrogryposis.Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to screen potential variations in the proband. Suspected variations were analyzed with bioinformatics software and validated by Sanger sequencing.A heterozygous c.1123G>A (p.Glu375Lys) variation was detected in the proband and an affected fetus from pedigree 1, while a de novo heterozygous c.118 G>A (p.Val40Met) variation was detected in an affected fetus from pedigree 2.The two heterozygous variations of the MYH3 gene probably underlie the disease in the pedigrees. Above results have facilitated genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.
