Title : A novel congenital myopathy with apoptotic changes.
Date : 2000
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report on a female child with congenital myopathy with delayed developmental milestones and mental retardation. The most striking pathological finding was the presence of many condensed to fragmented myonuclei. DNA fragmentation was confirmed by the TUNEL method and supported by the ultrastructural characteristics of apoptotic nuclear changes. We also demonstrated immunohistochemically the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. This appears to be the first reported case of congenital myopathy with apoptotic process.
