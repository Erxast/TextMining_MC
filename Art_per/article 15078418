Title : Prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement in a sporadic desmin related myopathy and cardiomyopathy.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Desminopathy is a neuromuscular disorder associated with the accumulation of the protein desmin. This article reports a case of a man with a mutation in the desmin gene suffering from cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy. This patient underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation for prognostic considerations and subsequently developed a sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT). While nonsustained VTs (NSVT) have previously been reported, this is the first time that a SVT could be seen in a patient with this disease.
