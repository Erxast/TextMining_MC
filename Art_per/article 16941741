Abstract : Congenital myopathies are clinical and genetic heterogeneous disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and specific structural changes in muscle fiber. Congenital myopathy with fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is an established disorder of congenital myopathy. CFTD is characterized by non-progressive childhood neuromuscular disorders with a relatively good prognosis and type 1 fiber predominance and smallness. Congenital myopathy with type 1 fiber predominance (CMT1P) is also a distinct entity of congenital myopathy characterized by non-progressive childhood neuromuscular disorders and type 1 fiber predominance without smallness. Little is known about CMT1P. Clinical characteristics, including dysmorphic features such as hip dislocation, kyphoscoliosis, contracture, and high arch palate, were analyzed along with laboratory and muscle pathologies in six patients with CMT1P and three patients with CFTD. The clinical manifestations of CFTD and CMT1P were similar. However, the frequency of dysmorphic features is less in CMT1P than in CFTD. Long term observational studies of CMT1P are needed to determine if it will change to another form of congenital myopathy or if CMT1P is a distinct clinical entity.
