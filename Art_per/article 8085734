Abstract : The management of congenital and acquired subglottic stenosis has been considerably facilitated with the introduction of the anterior cricoid split operation and, more recently, the single-stage laryngotracheoplasty. These procedures are followed by a 1- to 2-week period of sedation, during which the patient is paralyzed and completely dependent on mechanical ventilation. Although these procedures have proven very successful at achieving decannulation, the postoperative period can be the source of significant complications. This is illustrated with 4 cases of severe postoperative complications. The possible pathophysiologic causes are discussed, and the literature concerning the postoperative complications of these procedures is reviewed. The avoidance of neuromuscular blockade must be weighed against the possible increased need for narcotics and increased risk of self-extubation. An intensive care unit setting proficient in the care of these patients is necessary for a successful outcome.
