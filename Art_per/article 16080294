Abstract : A new mutation of the Noggin gene in a French Fybrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) family: Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a very rare disease characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes and progressive heterotopic ossification of the muscles. We previously located a FOP gene in the 17q21-22 region and described several mutations of the noggin (NOG) gene (located in 17q22) in four FOP patients, including the G91C mutation which is transmitted dominantly in a Spanish FOP family. We describe in the present study a new mutation of the NOG gene in a French FOP family. This new mutation is a guanine to adenine change at nucleotide 283 (283G --> A) of the NOG gene, and is transmitted in the family (in the heterozygote form) by the affected mother to her two affected children. At the peptide level this mutation (A95T) substitutes an Alanine residue by a Threonine at position 95 of the Noggin protein. The Alanine mutated residue is located just adjacent to the myristoylation site of the protein, where all the mutations we described until now are located.
