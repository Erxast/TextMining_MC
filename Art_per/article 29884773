Abstract : α-Dystroglycan (α-DG) is a highly glycosylated cell-surface laminin receptor. Defects in the <i>O</i>-mannosyl glycan of an α-DG with laminin-binding activity can cause α-dystroglycanopathy, a group of congenital muscular dystrophies. In the biosynthetic pathway of functional <i>O</i>-mannosyl glycan, fukutin (FKTN) and fukutin-related protein (FKRP), whose mutated genes underlie α-dystroglycanopathy, sequentially transfer ribitol phosphate (RboP) from CDP-Rbo to form a tandem RboP unit (RboP-RboP) required for the synthesis of the laminin-binding epitope on <i>O</i>-mannosyl glycan. Both RboP- and glycerol phosphate (GroP)-substituted glycoforms have recently been detected in recombinant α-DG. However, it is unclear how GroP is transferred to the <i>O</i>-mannosyl glycan or whether GroP substitution affects the synthesis of the <i>O</i>-mannosyl glycan. Here, we report that, in addition to having RboP transfer activity, FKTN and FKRP can transfer GroP to <i>O</i>-mannosyl glycans by using CDP-glycerol (CDP-Gro) as a donor substrate. Kinetic experiments indicated that CDP-Gro is a less efficient donor substrate for FKTN than is CDP-Rbo. We also show that the GroP-substituted glycoform synthesized by FKTN does not serve as an acceptor substrate for FKRP and that therefore further elongation of the outer glycan chain cannot occur with this glycoform. Finally, CDP-Gro inhibited the RboP transfer activities of both FKTN and FKRP. These results suggest that CDP-Gro inhibits the synthesis of the functional <i>O</i>-mannosyl glycan of α-DG by preventing further elongation of the glycan chain. This is the first report of GroP transferases in mammals.
