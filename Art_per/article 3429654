Title : Management of hip dislocations in children with arthrogryposis.
Date : 1987 Nov-Dec
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : From a review of 131 children with arthrogryposis, we studied 18 patients with hip dislocations. Fourteen patients (10 unilateral, four bilateral) were treated by open reduction. Mean age at surgery was 9.7 months, and follow-up ranged from 9 to 245 months. Range of motion of patients treated by open reduction following the medial approach was greater than in those treated by anterolateral incision and greater than in bilateral cases treated by closed reduction. Acetabular development was satisfactory following the medial approach and there were no re-dislocations, but one hip developed avascular necrosis.
