Abstract : We describe a novel genetic and kinetic defect in a slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome. The severely disabled propositus has advanced endplate myopathy, prolonged and biexponentially decaying endplate currents, and prolonged acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel openings. Genetic analysis reveals the heterozygous mutation alphaV249F in the propositus and mosaicism for alphaV249F in the asymptomatic father. Unlike mutations described previously in the M2 transmembrane domain, alphaV249F is located N-terminal to the conserved leucines and is not predicted to face the channel lumen. Expression of the alphaV249F AChR in HEK fibroblasts demonstrates increased channel openings in the absence of ACh, prolonged openings in its presence, enhanced steady-state desensitization, and nanomolar rather than micromolar affinity of one of the two binding sites in the resting activatable state. Thus, neuromuscular transmission is compromised because cationic overloading leads to degenerating junctional folds and loss of AChR, because an increased fraction of AChR is desensitized in the resting state, and because physiological rates of stimulation elicit additional desensitization and depolarization block of transmission.
