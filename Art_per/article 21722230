Abstract : Case reports have linked malignant hyperthermia (MH) to several genetic diseases.The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess excess comorbidities associated with MH diagnosis in pediatric hospital discharge records.Data for this study came from the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) for the years 2000, 2003, and 2006. The KID contains an 80% random sample of patients under the age of 21 discharged from short-term, non-Federal hospitals in the United States, with up to 19 diagnoses recorded for each patient. Using all pediatric inpatients as the reference, we calculated the standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for children with MH diagnosis according to major disease groups and specific medical conditions.Of the 5,916,989 nonbirth-related hospital discharges studied, 175 had a recorded diagnosis of MH. Compared with the general pediatric inpatient population, children with MH diagnosis were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (SMR 5.7; 95% CI: 3.9-7.9), diseases of the circulatory system (SMR 3.3; 95% CI: 2.1-4.8), and congenital anomalies (SMR 3.2; 95% CI: 2.3-4.4). The specific diagnosis that was most strongly associated with MH was muscular dystrophies (SMR 31.3; 95% CI 12.6-64.6).Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue are significantly associated with MH diagnosis in children. Further research is warranted to determine the clinical utility of these comorbidities in assessing MH susceptibility in children.
