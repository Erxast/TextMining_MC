Abstract : Reconstruction of the first web is an important technique for thumb adduction contracture accompanying congenital anomalies. Our previous cases have been reviewed here to evaluate and compare the indications, results, and problems for these two techniques. The angle formed by the first and second metacarpals (first-second metacarpal angle; 1-2 MCA) on the anterio-posterior (AP) view of the hand, with the thumb in maximum radial abduction, was measured from X-ray. There were 37 patients (43 hands: 27 males, ten females). The average age at the time of surgery was 6.6 years (range, two to 22 years). The five-flap Z-plasty was performed on 20 hands. The spinner flap was performed on 23 hands. The Spinner flap is indicated when contractures are severe or when the preoperative 1-2 MCA is <20°. The five-flap Z-plasty is indicated when contractures are mild or when the preoperative 1-2 MCA is ≥20°.
