Abstract : We describe the maternal and neonatal complications of pregnancy in two patients with myotonic dystrophy. The disease leads to an increased spontaneous abortion rate, hydramnios, prolonged first and second stages of labour, retained placenta, postpartum haemorrhages and anaesthetic sensitivity in the mother. The neonatal problems are caused by the congenital form of the disease. The major clinical features of congenital myotonic dystrophy are bilateral facial weakness, hypotonia, neonatal distress, feeding difficulties, talipes, tent-shaped mouth, mental retardation and delayed motor development. Relatives of a known myotonic dystrophy patient should be advised to let themselves be examined for this disease. If the disease is diagnosed, information should be given regarding possibilities for prenatal diagnosis. Pregnancy in myotonic dystrophy patients should be monitored by a gynaecologist. Labour has to take place in a hospital with intensive care facilities for mother and child.
