Title : Neonatal diaphragmatic dysfunction.
Date : 1976
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Several unusual diaphragmatic problems in the neonate are presented and a new potential complication of the negative pressure respirator is illustrated. The association of bilateral diaphragmatic eventrations with chromosome anomalies is emphasized. In our experience the appearance of the chest on frontal and lateral views is usually so characteristic that no further evaluation is required. The relationship between several neuromuscular disorders and diaphragmatic dysfunction is discussed. A case of congenital myotonic dystrophy with unilateral eventration is illustrated.
