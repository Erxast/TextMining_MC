Abstract : THE ROLE OF IONIC CHANNEL DYSFUNCTION: During various neurological diseases has been evoked for many years on electro-physiological data. Molecular biology has led to great progress in neurology, and can be considered "functional" since it is surpasses the classical anatomo-clinical methods. IONIC CHANNEL DYSFUNCTION: Can be determined genetically, resulting from the mutation of a gene code of a channel sub-unit. CHANNELOPATHIES ARE RESPONSIBLE: For muscular diseases (myotonia, familial periodic paralysis, malignant hyperthermia and congenital myasthenia), but also for central nervous system disorders such as familial hemiplegic migraine, hereditary paroxystic ataxia and certain forms of Mendel's law hereditary epilepsy. ACQUIRED IONIC CHANNEL DYSFUNCTION: Resulting from auto-immune aggression is implied in diseases such as Lambert-Eaton's myasthenic syndrome and Isaac's neuromyotonia syndrome. It probably plays a part in the clinical, and particularly the sensitive expression (paresthesia and pain) of some peripheral neuropathies and certain central nervous system affections, such as multiple sclerosis.
