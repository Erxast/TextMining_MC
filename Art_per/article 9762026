Abstract : During twin pregnancies, several complications may result in the death of a co-twin depending on the date of death. We describe herein 2 infant survivors of monozygotic twin pairs with 2 distinct possible complications: a aplasia cutis congenita and Volkmann ischemic contracture.One infant had extensive aplasia cutis congenita with an associated monozygotic co-twin who died at 3 months of gestation, and the other child had a localized arm defect due to Volkmann ischemic contracture and brain damage, with a co-twin who died at approximately 6 weeks of gestation.Congenital cutaneous defects may result in the death of a co-twin. The most common of these defects is aplasia cutis congenita associated with a fetus papyraceus or a dead fetus related to ischemic/thrombotic events in the placenta and fetus. Volkmann ischemic contracture is rare in the newborn but can cause neonatal cutaneous defects. The cause of Volkmann ischemic contracture in newborns is unknown; however, our second observation suggests the possible role of a dead fetus.
