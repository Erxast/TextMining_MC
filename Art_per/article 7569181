Abstract : The clinical features of two children with myositis ossificans progressiva are described. Skeletal malformations can be observed in many sites: hand, femur, tibia and spine. Phalangeal abnormalities (shortened hallux, hallux valgus) are essential to the diagnosis. We recommend systematic roentgenographic examination to search for other skeletal malformations for congenital hallux valgus in young children because it can be the first sign of myositis ossificans progressiva. Progression of disability does not seem to be influenced by any form of medical treatment. Surgical removal of ectopic bone is thought to be followed inevitably by rapid recalcification at the original site.
