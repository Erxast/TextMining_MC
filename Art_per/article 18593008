Abstract : We report on two unrelated patients clinically presenting with late-onset progressive limb girdle weakness; cardiomyopathy was seen in one patient. Muscle biopsy revealed a necrotic myopathy with numerous rimmed vacuoles, ultrastructurally typical paired-helical filaments, and reduced immunohistochemical staining for alpha-dystroglycan. Quadriceps sparing hereditary inclusion body myopathy due to mutations in GNE gene, and OPMD due to PABPN1 mutations were excluded, genetically. We detected a homozygous mutation of the FKRP gene (826C>A) in both patients. Mutations of FKRP have been reported in congenital muscular dystrophies, LGMD2I, cardiomyopathy and hyperCKemia, but not in myopathies with vacuoles and paired-helical filaments. Therefore, our findings further extend the morphological variability of muscular dystrophies due to FKRP mutations.
