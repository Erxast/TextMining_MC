Abstract : Case report of a 7-year-old male patient, diagnosed with idiopathic progressive corneal alteration developed within a period of 6 months.Description of type 2 distal arthrogryposis affecting hands and feet, a bilateral, congenital hearing loss, alterations such as keloid-like scarring, congenital heart disease, and cryptorchidism with no relevant family history.Corrected visual acuity in the right eye (RE) was 0.5 and in the left eye was 1 and, in addition to that, a bilateral corneal subepithelial fibrosis that was denser in the RE without neovessels and no signs of inflammatory activity.This is the first publication relating arthrogryposis with corneal affectation, probably because of a collagen anomaly characteristic in these patients.
