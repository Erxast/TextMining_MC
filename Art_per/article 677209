Date : 1978
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We studied four patients with the general fibrosis syndrome. One patient had bilateral inguinal hernias and unilateral cryptorchism; the other patients had no other congenital abnormalities. The patients developed normally both neurologically and metally. We successfully treated amblyopia and achieved good functional and cosmetic results with strabismus and blepharoptosis surgery. Histopathologic study revealed fibrous infiltration of extrinsic eye muscle and Tenon's capsule without inflammatory changes.
