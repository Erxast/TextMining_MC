Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A local flap, utilizing the skin over the dorsum of the thumb, for release of a first web space contracture has been described. Its construction allows for full integumentary release, adequate visualization of underlying contracted tissues, and a closure that provides full thickness sensory skin coverage over the entire web space and key pinch contact area.
