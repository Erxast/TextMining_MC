Abstract : Within the group of inflammatory myopathies, dermatomyositis is the most frequent disease occurring in childhood. Although most children usually present with muscle disease and dermatological symptoms, a small number of these patients does not manifest myopathy at the time of disease onset. They are therefore diagnosed with juvenile amyopathic dermatomyositis. Sometimes, other organs systems can also be affected, such as the lung, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. As to the latter, the occurrence of cardiac symptoms such as arrhythmia or conduction defects are rare. Here, we report for the first time a patient with childhood amyopathic dermatomyositis and concomitant congenital heart anomalies, including coarctation of the aorta.
