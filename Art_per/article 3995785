Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In a study of 350 patients with multiple congenital contractures (arthrogryposis), 80 (23%) patients had mental retardation or were developmentally delayed. Out of that group of 80 patients, 13 (16%) were found to have abnormal karyotypes. Two of the thirteen had a family history of chromosomal abnormalities without congenital contractures, therefore, 11 patients had chromosomal anomalies which appeared to be associated with the congenital contractures. Five of the eleven (45%) had chromosome mosaicism, three of those had tissue mosaicism. Two had abnormal skin fibroblast cell lines and normal peripheral leukocyte chromosome studies and one had a normal bone marrow karyotype with abnormal peripheral leukocyte chromosome studies. Chromosome studies were done in these patients with congenital contractures because of developmental delay and multisystem involvement, or recognition of clinical features typical of a chromosomal syndrome. We recommend first lymphocyte; and if those are normal, then fibroblast studies be done on all patients with multiple joint contractures and developmental delay, particularly if unusual facial features or multisystem abnormalities are present.
