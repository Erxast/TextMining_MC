Abstract : Nemaline myopathy type 6 (NEM6), KBTBD13-related congenital myopathy is caused by mutated KBTBD13 protein that interacts improperly with thin filaments/actin, provoking impaired muscle-relaxation kinetics. We describe muscle morphology in 18 Dutch NEM6 patients and correlate it with clinical phenotype and pathophysiological mechanisms. Rods were found in in 85% of biopsies by light microscopy, and 89% by electron microscopy. A peculiar ring disposition of rods resulting in ring-rods fiber was observed. Cores were found in 79% of NEM6 biopsies by light microscopy, and 83% by electron microscopy. Electron microscopy also disclosed granulofilamentous protein material in 9 biopsies. Fiber type 1 predominance and prominent nuclear internalization were found. Rods were immunoreactive for Î±-actinin and myotilin. Areas surrounding the rods showed titin overexpression suggesting derangement of the surrounding sarcomeres. NEM6 myopathology hallmarks are prominent cores, rods including ring-rods fibers, nuclear clumps, and granulofilamentous protein material. This material might represent the histopathologic epiphenomenon of altered interaction between mutated KBTBD13 protein and thin filaments. We claim to classify KBTBD13-related congenital myopathy as rod-core myopathy.
