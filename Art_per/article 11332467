Title : Facial and skeletal malformations, mental retardation, aganglionosis, and neurogenic muscle weakness: a variant of Niikawa-Kuroki syndrome or a new syndrome?
Date : 2001
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a 10-year-old boy with multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome, who also presented with aganglionosis and neurogenic muscle weakness. Some phenotypic manifestations of our patient overlap with those observed in the Niikawa-Kuroki syndrome; however, the hypothesis of a new distinct entity, with simultaneous involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system, is considered.
