Abstract : We evaluated 85 children with congenital chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIP) over the past 10 years. Twelve (14%) were born prematurely. One had a family history of CIP. Six had systemic diseases. Thirty-five (41%) had urinary bladder involvement. Manometric features were consistent with myopathy in 32, neuropathy in 48, and mixed disease in 5. Of 48 patients with neuropathy, 6 had urinary bladder involvement (12.5%) (P < 0.0001 vs myopathy), and 10 had malrotation (21%) (P = NS vs myopathy). Upon referral, 53 (62%) were dependent on partial or total parenteral nutrition (PN). At the time of chart review (median 25 months after evaluation), 22 patients had died, 14 of whom were on total PN, 13 of them died because of PN-related complications and 1 died of sepsis. Three others died of sepsis while on partial PN (P = 0.007 vs mortality in patients fed enterally) and five died after small bowel transplantation. In conclusion, in children with congenital CIP, the risk for prematurity is increased twofold, the majority of cases are sporadic, abnormal bladder function is more common in myopathic CIP, and complications related to parenteral nutrition are the main cause of death in children with CIP.
