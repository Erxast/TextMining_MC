Abstract : The neuromuscular disorders encountered in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) encompass a broad spectrum of pathologies. These include acute disorders (eg, Guillain-Barre syndrome), acute-on-chronic disorders (eg, myasthenia gravis), progressive disorders (eg, muscular dystrophy), and disorders that develop in the PICU (eg, critical illness myopathy/polyneuropathy). Familiarity with the presenting features of these disorders is of paramount importance in facilitating timely diagnosis.We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of patients admitted to the PICU or Intermediate Care Program (ICP) at a single tertiary children's hospital from 2006 to 2017 with an acute or acute-on-chronic neuromuscular disorder. We did not include patients with a known progressive neuromuscular disorder or critical illness myopathy/polyneuropathy.Twenty-four patients were admitted to the PICU/ICP with acute or acute-on-chronic neuromuscular disorders. Diagnosis and indication for ICU/ICP admission were Guillain-Barre syndrome (n = 6; respiratory failure: 3, respiratory monitoring: 2, autonomic instability: 1), myasthenia gravis (n = 5; airway clearance: 3, respiratory failure: 2), acute flaccid myelitis (n = 3; respiratory failure: 2, respiratory monitoring: 1), periodic paralysis (n = 3; intravenous potassium replacement), rhabdomyolysis (n = 3; monitoring for electrolyte derangements), infant botulism (n = 2; respiratory failure), chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy (n = 1; respiratory failure), and congenital myasthenic syndrome (n = 1; apnea). No patients were admitted to the PICU/ICP with a diagnosis of tick paralysis, acute intermittent porphyria, or inflammatory myopathy.Although acute and acute-on-chronic neuromuscular disorders are encountered relatively rarely in the PICU, familiarity with the presenting features of these disorders is important in facilitating timely diagnosis. This, in turn, enables the institution of effective management strategies, thereby avoiding complications associated with diagnostic delays.
