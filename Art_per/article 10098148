Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder involving muscle, brain, heart, eyes, and endocrine organs. The underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide CTG repeat in the 3'prime untranslated region of a serine-threonine kinase gene on chromosome 19q. A statistical correlation exists between the CTG copy number and the severity of the disease. Infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the CTG repeat than is seen in the non-congenital myotonic dystrophy population. However, not all patients with many CTG copies develop congenital myotonic dystrophy. We present 13 patients with more than 1500 CTG trinucleotide repeats and show their variable clinical course.
