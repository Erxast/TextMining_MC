Abstract : What should you do if you observe a defective calf in a herd? Our suggestion is to seek qualified help to examine and diagnose the condition. Parentage should be verified by blood typing. But, most important, you can keep cattle genetically clean by having your clients report all defects in calves to their breed association and artificial insemination centers.
