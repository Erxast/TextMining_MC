Abstract : In this edition, we focus on neuromuscular junction disorders and myopathy. The newly published international consensus guidelines for the management of myasthenia gravis are reviewed. In addition, various emerging treatment options for myasthenia, including the use of methotrexate, rituximab, subcutaneous immunoglobulin, and thymectomy, are discussed. Recent studies examining the clinical and genetic features of several forms of congenital myasthenia gravis are also highlighted. The clinical features and treatment of late-onset Pompe disease are reviewed, as are studies in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and calpainopathy.
