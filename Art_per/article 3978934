Title : Passive motion therapy for infants with arthrogryposis.
Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A comprehensive program for treatment of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita has been developed based on experiences with 95 infants and young children with arthrogrypotic deformities. The regimen emphasizes early passive stretching and serial splinting to improve joint motion. Ninety percent of the patients had contractures of all extremities; 40% had multiple congenital anomalies. Daily intensive passive stretching of joints and serial splinting have substantially increased patient function in this population. Surgical procedures have been used only in cases in which persistent deformities require correction.
