Abstract : Giant congenital pigmented nevi pose a substantial reconstructive challenge for the treating physician. Due to the increased risk of malignant transformation in such lesions, complete excision with tissue expansion or skin grafting is the generally accepted treatment. These modalities can, however, leave the patient with secondary deformities that also require complex reconstructive procedures. The following case details a patient requiring secondary reconstruction with large-volume tissue expansion 12 years after excision of a giant nevus, and split-thickness skin grafting. This patient illustrates a severe secondary deformity and the usefulness of large-volume serial expansion in such patients.
