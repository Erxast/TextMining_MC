Abstract : Congenital convex pes valgus is a rare, complex and heterogeneous anomaly of the foot, which is difficult to treat. From 1985 to 1994, we treated 14 patients (20 feet) with this deformity. There were six boys and eight girls. Six patients had bilateral involvement. Their ages at the time of surgery ranged from 4 to 32 months (mean, 13 mo). In eight patients (10 feet), the etiology was arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. The eitiology was unknown in six patients (10 feet). Associated problems included hip dislocation in seven patients, flexion or extension contractures of the knee in six patients, and clubfoot deformity in three patients. One patient had undergone previous surgery for release of a knee contracture. To achieve a plantigrade and balanced foot, all patients had one-stage surgical open reduction and circumferential release for the correction of deformities. At a minimum of 2 years following surgery, 11 patients (16 feet) had satisfactory results determined by a 10-point evaluation system based on both clinical and radiographic features. Satisfactory results and ambulatory prognosis were related to the etiology and severity of each patient's condition. Two patients (two feet) had scars with poor cosmetic appearance and two patients (three feet) had inadequate correction. We concluded that with adequate soft tissue release and complete talocalcaneonavicular joint reduction in one-stage surgery, proper postoperative maintenance, and physical therapy, satisfactory results in the treatment of congenital convex pes valgus can be achieved.
