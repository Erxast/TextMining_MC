Title : Familial thrombocytopenia and myopathy.
Date : 1989
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a family in which a combination of myopathy and thrombocytopenia is transmitted as an autosomal dominant characteristic through three generations. The myopathy has unusual histological features with type II fibre atrophy and vacuolation while the thrombocytopenia appears to be due to a defect in megakaryocyte maturation, platelet morphology and function being normal. The haematological findings in such a family have not been described previously.
