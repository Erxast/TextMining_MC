Abstract : All children with cerebral palsy who had a pelvic osteotomy performed by the senior author (F.M.) from 1989 through 1991 were reviewed. Indications for operative reconstruction were failed muscle lengthening in a child younger than 8 years or a painful hip. The operative procedure included adductor muscle lengthening, varus shortening femoral osteotomy, and peri-ilial pelvic osteotomy. Patients were immediately mobilized after surgery by physical therapy. Fifty-one children had reconstruction of 49 subluxated and 21 dislocated hips. Femoral and pelvic osteotomies were performed on 59 hips, and 11 hips had only a femoral osteotomy. Forty-nine hips had adductor muscle lengthening, and 27 hips had femoral osteotomy to provide for relief of contractures. At mean follow-up of 34 months, two hips in two patients had redislocated, requiring repeated surgery. Two hips remained subluxated and asymptomatic. Twenty-three hips in 18 patients were painful before surgery. One hip continued with severe pain after surgery, requiring further surgery. Three hips continued with mild pain not requiring surgery, and 14 (82%) hips had complete pain relief. Of 37 caretakers interviewed, 80% felt the procedure was beneficial and would recommend it to others. Eight percent were uncertain, and 6% (two caretakers) thought it was not helpful.
