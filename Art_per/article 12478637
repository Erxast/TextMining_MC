Title : Hypoechogenicity of fetal long bones: a new ultrasound marker for arthrogryposis.
Date : 2002
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : To demonstrate osteopenia associated with arthrogryposis.We describe 3 cases of fetal arthrogryposis seen prenatally with the sonographic feature of severe hypoechogenicity of the long bones. This manifestation of presumed osteopenia is thought to represent osteoporosis secondary with absent fetal movement.We describe hypoechogenicity of the fetal bones as a new sonographic feature of arthrogryposis.
