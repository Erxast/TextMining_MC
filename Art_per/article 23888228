Abstract : Heart transplantation is an established procedure with acceptable, predictable long-term results and good quality of life for more than 20 years. However, it is only available for a limited number of patients. The fate of the patients is determined by the side effects of immunosuppressive drugs, increased tumor incidence and chronic vascular transplant disease. Patients living 10 to 20 years after heart transplantation show physical status equal to that of patients with various chronic illnesses. They suffer from chronic side effects of long-term medication and mainly report fears of renal insufficiency followed by osteoporosis-associated pain, cortisone-induced myopathy and risk for tumors. Only moderate psychological impairment is reported despite somatic problems. In the period 10-20 years post-heart transplantation, there is even a surprising increase in emotional well-being. The 20-year survivors are active and satisfied with daily life. They experience their own life as meaningful and have good partner, family and social relations. Heart transplantation, the most ambitious project in medicine in the 20th century has been made a reality. Its development has the strongest impact on cardiac surgery, immunology, pharmacology, medical logistics, defining life and death, ethics in medicine, acceptance of medical progress by the public and by health care systems. It has  provided a strong  solidarity among politicians, sociologists, physicians and citizens. Ethical concerns will last and will make heart transplantation an important, yet temporary episode in human medicine. It has stimulated research and development of mechanical circulatory support systems as an alternative to treat end-stage heart failure.
