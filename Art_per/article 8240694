Title : Unusual fetal movement in congenital myotonic dystrophy.
Date : 1993 May-Jun
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital myotonic dystrophy is the most extreme and early expression of a multisystem autosomal dominant disorder. Decreased fetal and infantile movement is a defining feature. We report a case of congenital myotonic dystrophy with an unusual pattern of persistent repetitive fetal movements detected by a Doppler fetal movement detector.
