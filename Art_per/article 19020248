Abstract : Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is an uncommon congenital anomaly affecting young adults who present with symptoms of calf claudication. It is characterized by various anomalous anatomic relationships between the muscle and arteries in the popliteal fossa, resulting in extrinsic arterial compression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential role of CT angiography (CTA) and MRI in the diagnosis of PAES.Eight patients (11 legs) who underwent surgical treatment for PAES over a 4-year period were included in this study. All of the cases showed various anomalous relationships between the popliteal artery and the neighboring muscular structures. CTA and MRI showed the detailed anatomy of the region well enough to reveal the cause of arterial entrapment. CTA defined the location and length of the occluded segment and collateral circulation.Characterization and classification based on CTA and MRI findings were consistent with intraoperative photography.CTA and MRI can show anatomic variations in the popliteal fossa and may be valuable in the diagnosis of PAES in young adults presenting with intermittent claudication.
