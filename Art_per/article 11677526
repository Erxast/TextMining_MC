Date : 2001
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Patients afflicted with congenital/developmental anomalies of the oral/head and neck regions present the prosthodontist with unique esthetic and functional restorative challenges. This article reviews the various pediatric patient categories that would benefit from placement of "vital" overdentures. A long-term follow-up of patients seen over 25 years of practice is presented with a focus on complications such as temporomandibular joint stability, caries, soft tissue and bony support changes, and denture adaptation. Longitudinal follow-up of these patients indicates that, although problems occur with overdenture therapy, the benefits of this treatment far outweigh the complications.
