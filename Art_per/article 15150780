Abstract : We describe an infant with multiple congenital anomalies including cleft palate and micrognathia, MÃ¶bius sequence, developmental delay, myopathy, hydronephrosis, and bilateral clubfeet. These features are consistent with Carey-Fineman-Ziter (CFZ) syndrome (MIM 254940), which has been previously reported in six children (including two sibling pairs). Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an unusually small pons, a finding not previously described in CFZ syndrome.
