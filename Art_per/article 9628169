Title : Sleep-disordered breathing in a patient with congenital myopathy.
Date : 1998
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case of adult onset myopathy who showed a peculiar sleep-related respiratory disorder (SRRD) is reported. She recovered from respiratory failure after tracheostomy and/or with the aid of the respirator used only during the night. Sleep study without the use of respirator revealed that her sleep was highly fragmented by frequent arousal responses due to inspiratory effort but not by apnea or hypopnea. To our knowledge this type of SRRD has not been described.
