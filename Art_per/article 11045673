Abstract : To investigate the pathophysiologic role of myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) in the brain in myotonic dystrophy (MD), the developmental characteristics of DMPK immunoreactivity in the central nervous system and its alteration with disease were studied. Eleven patients' brain with MD (5 congenital form, 6 adult form) were examined by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody against synthetic DMPK peptides, antipeptide DM1, and compared with 30 control brains, including 16 age-matched controls. In controls, DM1-immunoreactive neurons appeared in the early fetal frontal cortex and cerebellar granule cell layer, persisting through 29 weeks of gestation and then disappearing. In contrast, immunoreactive neurons continued to persist in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar granule cell layer of MD patients. When we counted DM1-immunoreactive neurons, the increase over controls was greater in the congenital form of MD than in the adult form, and was greater in the cerebrum than in the cerebellum in both forms of MD. DM1 immunostaining was predominantly nuclear, mirroring Western blotting of subcellular fractions. Differences in DM1 expression related to development and to the two forms of MD may be closely related to the pathogenesis of mental retardation in this disease.
