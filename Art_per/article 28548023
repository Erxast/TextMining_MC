Abstract : Ventricular septal defects are one of the most common congenital cardiac malformations in animals, and most often affect the membranous portion of the septum. These defects may rarely close spontaneously. An adult male black-tailed prairie dog ( Cynomys ludovicianus) had a smooth shiny botryoid red mass arising from the area of the septal cusp of the right atrioventricular (tricuspid) valve and membranous interventricular septum, and bulging into the right ventricular lumen. Histology and special staining demonstrated a membranous ventricular septal defect closed by the adherence of the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve to the muscular septum (so-called membranous ventricular septal aneurysm or aneurysm of the [peri]membranous ventricular septum). This is a rare finding in animals, and the histologic appearance has not been documented previously, to our knowledge.
