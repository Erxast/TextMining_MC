Abstract : Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue. CCA is characterized by arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, contrature of major joints, scoliosis, pectus deformities, and crumpled ears. The present study aimed to identify the genetic cause of a three-generation Chinese family with CCA. We successfully identified a novel missense mutation p.G1145D in the fibrillin-2 (<i>FBN2</i>) gene as the pathogenic mutation by whole exome sequencing (WES). The p.G1145D mutation occurs in the 12th calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domain. The p.G1145D mutation caused a hydrophobic to hydrophilic substitution, altering the amino acid property from neutral to acidic. Three-dimensional structural analysis showed that this mutation could alter the conformation of the residue side chain, thereby producing steric clashes with spatially adjacent residues, disrupting the formation of H bonds and causing folding destabilization. Therefore, this amino acid appears to play an important role in the structure and function of <i>FBN2</i>. Our results may also provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of CCA and may have implications for genetic counseling and clinical management.
