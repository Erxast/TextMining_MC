Title : Myogenic defects in myotonic dystrophy.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Myogenesis is the developmental program that generates and regenerates skeletal muscle. This process is impaired in patients afflicted with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Muscle development is disrupted in infants born with congenital DM1, and recent evidence suggests that defective regeneration may contribute to muscle weakness and wasting in affected adults. DM1 represents the first example of a human disease that is caused, at least in part, by pathogenic mRNA. Cell culture models have been used to demonstrate that mutant DM1 mRNA takes on a gain-of-function and inhibits myoblast differentiation. Although the molecular mechanism(s) by which this mutant mRNA disrupts myogenesis is not fully understood, recent findings suggest that anomalous RNA-protein interactions have downstream consequences that compromise key myogenic factors. In this review, we revisit morphological studies that revealed the nature of myogenic abnormalities seen in patients, describe cell culture systems that have been used to investigate this phenotype and discuss recent discoveries that for the first time have identified myogenic events that are disrupted in DM1.
