Abstract : A facial asymmetry patient caused by temporomandibular joint ankylosis was operated by putting a distraction osteogenesis (DO)-appliance. One week after surgery, the right mandible was distracted. Twenty days after distraction, the height of right mandibular ramus and body increased obviously. Four months after retain of DO-appliance, the right maxilla down-grew automatically and the occluding relation recovered to normal. The DO-appliance was taken out. MEDPOR prosthesis was imbedded in new bone and genioplasty was operated. The facial asymmetry and abnormal occluding relation of the patient were improved obviously.
