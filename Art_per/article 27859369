Abstract : Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) is a rare disorder, reported mainly in European adults, with occasional childhood cases. We report a series of 6 patients with pediatric MMF from the Indian subcontinent.Clinical details, creatine kinase levels, and results of electromyography are described for patients diagnosed with MMF. Fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed muscle biopsies were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy.Six of 2,218 muscle biopsies were diagnosed as MMF; patient charts were reviewed. The 6 patients were all children; all presented with hypotonia and/or motor delay. Mean age at diagnosis was 16.2 months. There were 4 boys and 2 girls. All had a history of hepatitis B vaccination. Histopathology revealed infiltration by sheets of large periodic acid-Schiff stain-positive histiocytes. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated needle-shaped crystals within histiocytes. One patient had a co-existent neuromuscular disorder, merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy.MMF is a rare inflammatory myopathy that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital myopathies in children.
