Abstract : Bifid condyles are uncommon and include post-traumatic aberrant reorganization of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and congenital forms.We report two cases of unilateral bifid condyles, responsible for functional dysfunction of the TMJ. The first case, probably of congenital origin, was oriented frontally. The second case, oriented in the sagittal plane, was probably post-traumatic. Functional treatment was used for both patients.Bifid condyles is asymptomatic in most cases. Their most frequent clinical consequence is TMJ pain. Surgical treatment is rarely indicated. Determining the congenital or post-traumatic origin of bifid condyles is often difficult. The orientation of the supernumerary condyle head could help for the etiological diagnosis.
