Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In the last year, published works on paralytic strabismus have concerned many topics. New advances have been made in the knowledge of epidemiology of ocular nerve palsies in children, muscular causes of paralytic strabismus, and neuroimaging management of patients with third nerve palsy who are at risk of cerebral aneurysms. The author describes reports on rare associations of oculomotor imbalances and neurologic diseases as well as atypical orbital localizations of tumors. He also discuss new neuroimaging findings in congenital superior oblique muscle palsy and new acquisitions on cyclofusion deterioration in acquired trochlear palsy.
