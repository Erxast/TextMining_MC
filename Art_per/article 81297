Title : The longitudinal course of congenital rubella encephalitis in nonretarded children.
Date : 1978
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The neurologic course of congenital rubella syndrome was traced in 29 nonretarded children to 9 to 12 years. During the first two years, manifestations involved abnormal tone and reflexes (69%), motor delays (66%), feeding difficulties (48%), and abnormal clinical behavior (45%). Hearing loss was documented in 76%. From three to seven years, poor balance, motor incoordination (69%), and behavioral disturbances (66%) predominated. Hearing losses increased to 86%. Currently, at 9 to 12 years, 25 have residua which include learning deficits (52%), behavioral disturbances (48%), poor balance (61%), muscle weakness (54%), and deficits in tactile perception (41%). Two additional children now have hearing loss. The encephalitic manifestations of congenital rubella syndrome are diverse. Overriding problems differ at each phase of childhood. Current deficits influence progress in educational and home environments. For these children, adequate intelligence alone does not guarantee academic success.
