Title : A new recessive syndrome of unusual facies and multiple structural abnormalities.
Date : 1991
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two sibs with a similar pattern of dysmorphic facial features and multiple structural abnormalities are reported. Both had a normal karyotype. The parents are first cousins and neither shows any stigmata of the disorder. In view of the consanguinity and pattern of malformations, autosomal recessive inheritance seems likely.
