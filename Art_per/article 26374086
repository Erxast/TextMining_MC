Abstract : The distal arthrogryposis (DA) syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by congenital contractures of limbs. According to phenotypical characteristics, DA syndromes have been clinically classified into 10 types. Currently, at least nine disease causing genes have been identified for different types of DA. Here, we report a 3-generation Chinese pedigree with three DA affected members. We performed whole exome sequencing on two affected and one unaffected individuals of this family and successfully identified a novel missense mutation in TNNI2 as the pathogenic mutation. The TNNI2 gene encodes a subunit of the troponin complex, a contractile machinery of the muscle. The mutation p.F178C that could change the H-bond formation of a neighboring residue occurs at a highly conserved position, suggesting that this variation probably affects the TNNI2 protein function. Our study also demonstrates the power of whole exome sequencing in causal mutation identification for phenotypically variable and genetically heterogeneous disorders.
