Title : Lymphocyte capping in myotonic dystrophy.
Date : 1983
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Lymphocyte capping with antihuman immunoglobulin was studied in 16 cases of myotonic dystrophy, including two cases with the congenital form. Percentage capping after 1 hour incubation was reduced and the time course of the capping sequence was apparently delayed. The significance of these findings remains to be determined.
