Title : Spontaneous ruptures of the extensor tendons of the fingers in Madelung's deformity.
Date : 1991
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Madelung's deformity is a congenital malformation with a slow clinical and radiological evolution and few complications. However, we have seen six instances of spontaneous rupture of the extensor tendons of the fingers related to the deformity of the inferior radio-ulnar joint. Treatment consisted of resection of the ulnar head, stabilisation of the distal ulna, and repair of the extensor tendons by tendon transfers. We discuss the possibility of avoiding the tendon ruptures by treating the deformity at an early stage.
