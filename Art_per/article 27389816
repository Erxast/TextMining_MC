Abstract : Myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs) are hereditary muscle disorders characterized by distinct histopathological features. This review provides an overview of recent research with respect to new disease genes, clinical phenotypes, insights into pathomechanisms and therapeutic strategies.Beyond the known disease genes DES, FLNC, MYOT, CRYAB, ZASP, BAG3, FHL1 and TTN, mutations in PLEC, ACTA1, HSPB8 and DNAJB6 have also been associated with a MFM phenotype. Proteomic analysis revealed new information about the composition of protein aggregates in myotilinopathy and identified a new diagnostic marker. New animal models mirror central aspects of MFM pathology and novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of MFM were evaluated in cell and animal models.MFMs are an expanding and numerically significant group of protein aggregate diseases with marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Though no specific therapy is currently available, the generation of patient-mimicking cell and animal models now paves the way for the preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies.
