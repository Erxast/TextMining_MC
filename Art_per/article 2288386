Title : Muscle involvement in mucolipidosis IV.
Date : 1990
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 15-month-old boy, thought to have a congenital myopathy, was subsequently diagnosed as having mucolipidosis type IV, with typical membranous inclusions in muscle fibers. Involvement of skeletal muscle in this lysosomal storage disease may explain the motor delay and hypotonia that are its most common presenting signs.
