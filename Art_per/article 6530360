Date : 1984
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Report of a study of primary myopathies in children conducted within the framework of our program to evaluate the diagnostic potential of 1H NMR in muscular diseases. There are substantial differences in the in vitro 1H NMR response of skeletal muscles between normal children and children with congenital non progressive myopathies and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
