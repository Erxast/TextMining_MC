Abstract : Hereditary myopathies are a heterogeneous disorder known to be associated with more than 100 genes. Although hereditary myopathy subgroups can be partially described with traditional methods such as muscle biopsy, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is essential to reveal the disease's underlying genetic etiology and molecular mechanisms. In this study, we performed clinical exome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing (CES/WES) in 20 unrelated Turkish patients. Thirteen pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, including five novel variantswere detected in the 16 known hereditary myopathy genes. We achieved a high rate of diagnosis (65%) compared to previous studies. The most common condition noticed was limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), which should not be ignored in patients diagnosed with myopathy. CES or WES provides a certain molecular diagnosis from a broad perspective to demonstrate underlying genetic causes in heterogeneous disorders. Therefore, exome sequencing offers a higher and more complete diagnosis than the gene panel.
