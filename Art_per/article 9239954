Date : 1997
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case of congenital temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis which caused facial disfigurement, significant reduction in mouth opening, difficulties in feeding and breathing, and general interference with physical and mental development is presented. The wide range of manifestations exceed the typical picture of TMJ ankylosis and resemble a syndrome rather than an isolated defect of the TMJ.
