Abstract : <i>Purpose.</i> To compare the results of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for insertional Achilles tendinopathy (IAT) with or without Haglund's deformity. <i>Methods.</i> Between September 2014 and May 2015, all patients who underwent ESWT were retrospectively enrolled in this study. A total of 67 patients were available for follow-up and assigned into nondeformtiy group (<i>n</i> = 37) and deformtiy group (<i>n</i> = 30). Clinical outcomes were evaluated by VISA-A Score and 6-point Likert scale. <i>Results.</i> The VISA-A score increased in both groups, from 49.57 ± 9.98 at baseline to 83.86 ± 8.59 at 14.5 ± 7.2 months after treatment in nondeformity group (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and from 48.70 ± 9.38 at baseline to 67.78 ± 11.35 at 15.3 ± 6.7 months after treatment in deformity group (<i>P</i> < 0.001). However, there was a greater improvement in VISA-A Score for the nondeformity group compared with deformity group (<i>P</i> = 0.005). For the 6-point Likert scale, there were decreases from 3.92 ± 0.80 at baseline to 1.57 ± 0.73 at the follow-up time point in nondeformity group (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and from 4.0 ± 0.76 at baseline to 2.37 ± 1.03 at the follow-up time point in deformity group (<i>P</i> < 0.001). There was no significant difference in improvement of the 6-point Likert scale between both groups (<i>P</i> = 0.062). <i>Conclusions.</i> ESWT resulted in greater clinical outcomes in patients without Haglund's deformity compared with patients with Haglund's deformity.
