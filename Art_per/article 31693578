Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an extremely rare and severely disabling autosomal dominant disease that is yet to be clearly understood. The purpose of this review is to present recent literature on pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of FOP.FOP is characterized by congenital great toe deformity and progressive heterotopic ossifications in connective tissue. Heterotopic ossifications occur after painful flare-ups that can arise spontaneously or can be triggered by minor trauma. Each flare-up ultimately causes restriction of related-joint, and along with the others eventually leads to immobility. Death is usually caused by pulmonary complications because of chest wall involvement. The causative gene of FOP is activin A receptor type 1 (ACVR1), a bone morphogenetic protein-signalling component, which normally acts to inhibit osteoblastogenesis. The treatment of FOP is still preventive and supportive.Although there are still gaps in the underlying mechanism of FOP, effective treatment options, such as potential pharmacologic targets and cell-based therapies are promising for the future. Some of these were tested without a clinical trial setting, and are currently in the process of evidence-based research.
