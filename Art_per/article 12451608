Abstract : Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays an important role in plasma lipoprotein metabolism and the uptake of free fatty acid in muscle. Previous studies using transgenic mice showed that increased LPL leads to myopathies, but these results were controversial. To examine this hypothesis, we studied LPL transgenic rabbits, and our results refute the suggested role of LPL in the pathogenesis of myopathies.
