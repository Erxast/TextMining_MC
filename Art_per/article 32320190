Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Microstomia is a clinical condition of reduced mouth opening that can be acquired or congenital in origin. Problems associated with microstomia can be related to function, esthetics, or both. Management of microstomia due to facial burns is complex due to the presence of hypertrophic and contracture scars. Available treatment options can be broadly classified as surgical, nonsurgical, or both. Splints can be used to prevent the contraction of perioral musculature or to recuperate lost mouth opening. Various intraoral or extraoral, tooth-borne or tissue-borne, and static or dynamic appliances are in clinical use, but their designs are case specific. This case report explains the management of microstomia secondary to facial burns by using a dynamic splint in combination with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide and hyaluronidase.
