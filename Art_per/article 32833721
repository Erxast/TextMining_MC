Abstract : Laing distal myopathy (LDM) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the slow skeletal muscle fiber myosin heavy chain (MYH7) gene on chromosome 14q11.2. The classic LDM phenotype-including early-onset, initial involvement of foot dorsiflexors and great toe extensors, followed by weakness of neck flexors and finger extensors-is well documented. Since the original report by Laing et al in 1995, the spectrum of MYH7-related myopathies has expanded to include congenital myopathies, late-onset myopathies, myosin storage myopathy, and scapuloperoneal myopathies. Most patients with LDM harbor mutations in the midrod domain of the MYH7 gene, but rare cases document disease-associated mutations in the globular head region. In this report, we add to the medical literature by describing the clinicopathological findings in 8 affected family members from 4 new LDM families-including 2 with novel MYH7 mutations (Y162D and A1438P), one with dual mutations (V39M and K1617del), and one family (E1508del) with severe early-onset weakness associated with contractures, respiratory insufficiency, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Our families highlight the ever-expanding clinical spectrum and genetic variation of the skeletal myopathies related to MYH7 gene mutations.
