Abstract : To evaluate the long-term results at the donor site in children who underwent harvesting of autogenous fascia lata for frontalis suspension in ptosis correction.The study design consists of a retrospective, nonrandomized case series. Medical records of 30 patients were reviewed. Each patient was reexamined, evaluating bulging at the donor site. Muscle prolapse was graded as not visible and not palpable, not visible but palpable, mildly visible, or obviously visible. Measurement of the width and length of the leg scar was recorded. Discomfort at the donor site was graded as no discomfort, occasional discomfort, or frequent discomfort.The mean age of the patients was 7 years (range, 1-15), with a mean follow-up period of 27 months (range, 3-63 months). Fifteen patients (50%) had invisible and impalpable bulging, 2 patients (6.7%) had invisible but palpable bulging, 5 patients (16.7%) had mildly visible bulging, and 8 patients (26.7%) had obviously visible bulging. The mean width of the scar was 7.5 mm, and the mean length was 3.6 cm. Twenty-seven patients (90%) had no functional discomfort of the leg, 2 patients (6.7%) had occasional discomfort, and 1 patient (3.3%) had frequent discomfort that occurred during exercise.After fascia lata harvesting, most patients had no cosmetic complaints or functional complications. The technique of harvesting fascia lata using a Crawford stripper seems to be safe and satisfactory.
