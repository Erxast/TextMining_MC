Title : Earliest evidence for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or Larsen syndrome?
Date : 1997
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A sixteenth-century illustrated pamphlet from Great Britain suggests that documentary evidence may permit accurate diagnosis of pathological conditions in earlier societies. The document is of particular importance, since the presented congenital abnormalities, including cleft lip, spina bifida cystica, genu recurvatum, and talipes deformity are reported rarely in archaeological skeletal material. It is suggested that the combination of abnormalities may represent the earliest case of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or Larsen syndrome.
