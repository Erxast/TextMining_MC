Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Chikungunya and Zika virus infections are emerging diseases in the Americas, and dengue continues to be the most prevalent arthropod-borne virus in the world. These arbovirus diseases may spread by endemic transmission or as travel-related infections and have rapidly expanded their geographic distribution secondary to vector spread. All 3 share a similar clinical picture that includes a maculopapular rash. Zika is characterized by pruritic rash, low-grade fever, and arthralgia. Congenital nervous system malformations are a growing public-health concern. Chikungunya distinctive dermatologic manifestations include facial melanosis and bullous eruption. Dengue bleeding complications may be life-threatening and require inpatient management.
