Date : 1997
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an external fixator (Ilizarov apparatus) for the treatment of severe joint contractures in patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Thirteen knees and 16 feet were treated in 13 patients at an average age of 11.9 years. The knee flexion contractures were corrected from 38.9 degrees preoperatively to a mean of 6.5 degrees postoperatively and to 17.3 degrees at follow-up (34 months). In the foot deformities, the equinus position was corrected from 29.7 degrees to 7.8 degrees on average. This external fixator is an efficient tool for correction of deformities in arthrogryposis.
