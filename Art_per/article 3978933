Abstract : Multiple congenital contractures or arthrogryposis is a birth defect that occurs in approximately one in 3000 births. It can be seen in isolation or in association with other abnormalities. The etiologic and genetic basis of multiple congenital contractures is very heterogeneous. In order to understand the genetic basis and natural history of a specific case, a specific diagnosis must be made. Over 150 conditions are known in which multiple congenital contractures are a predominant sign. In this chapter, the emphasis is on a systematic differential diagnosis and consideration of empiric recurrent risk figures if a specific diagnosis cannot be reached.
