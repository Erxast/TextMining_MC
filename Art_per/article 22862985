Abstract : There are numerous conditions, such as trauma, cancer, congenital malformations, and progressive deforming skeletal diseases, that can compromise the function and architectonics of bones of craniofacial region. The need to develop new approaches for treatment of these disorders arises from the fact that conventional therapeutic strategies face many obstacles and limitations. The use of tissue engineering in regeneration of craniofacial bone structures is a very promising possibility and a great challenge for researchers and practitioners. Developments in stem cell biology and engineering have led to the discovery of different stem cell populations and biodegradable materials with suitable properties. This review summarizes the current achievements in tissue engineering of craniofacial bone, temporomandibular joint, and periodontal ligament.
