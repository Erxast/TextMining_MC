Abstract : CT analysis in 26 patients with well-identified muscle diseases, and 4 normal controls was performed to evaluate its diagnostic interest. Scans were obtained through pelvis, thigh and calves at comparable levels in all subjects. Results showed that elementary changes were devoid of specificity and density measurements did not significantly increase the diagnostic significance of images. A good correlation was found between the degrees of CT changes and clinical evaluation of the muscles. However, CT allowed a more precise study of abnormalities in muscles difficult to assess clinically and, in all pathological cases, led to a clear analysis of the topography and the selectivity of the pathological process. If safety criteria are fulfilled, CT would allow a precise follow-up study of muscle atrophies.
