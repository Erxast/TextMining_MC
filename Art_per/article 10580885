Abstract : Preliminary pharmacologic evidence suggests that tiagabine, a new presynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid-uptake inhibitor developed as an antiepileptic drug, may also relieve spasticity. This pilot study assessed the drug's efficacy in 14 children with congenital or acquired spastic quadriplegia and concomitant intractable epilepsy refractory to treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs. The primary outcome variable was change in motor function; the secondary outcome was change in seizure frequency. Tiagabine was initiated at 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day and then gradually titrated upward until seizures ceased, adverse effects supervened, or the maximum dose of 1.1 mg/kg/day was reached. When a modified Ashworth scale was used to assess motor function, a mean improvement of approximately 50% was observed. Common findings included improved tone, strength, coordination, range of motion, and relaxation of extremities, with less ataxia and wobbling. Mean reduction in seizure frequency was 50-74%. Randomized, double-blind controlled studies are needed to confirm the suggested efficacy of tiagabine in relieving chronic spasticity in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.
