Date : 2010
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Freeman Sheldon syndrome (FSS) is a rare, multiple congenital contracture syndrome that is relatively well-known, since affected children have a striking appearance. This entity was historically referred to as the "whistling-face syndrome". Malignant hyperthermia and hyperpyrexia have been documented in FSS after general anesthesia related to the neuropathy. We report a male neonate with FSS and hyperpyrexia without anesthesia. To our knowledge, our patient is the first in the literature with hyperpyrexia in the newborn period without anesthesia.
