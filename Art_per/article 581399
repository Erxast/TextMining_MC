Date : 1978
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : An eight-year-old male suffered from long-standing proximal muscle weakness, dramatically aggravated by febrile episodes. Neuromuscular work-up disclosed a myopathy with multiple central cores of non-familial nature. The presence of central cores in this patient as well as in the myopathy of malignant hyperpyrexia might suggest a pathophysiological basis common to both conditions.
