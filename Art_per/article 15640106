Abstract : We describe a seven-generation large family with talipomanus and talipes, 175 individuals in this family were involved. 32 affected individuals including 18 males and 14 females whose clinical features were different and 1 suspicious male were found. The talipomanus were symmetrical, and varus and valgus were caused by vertical talus. We investigated their living environment, the dietary habit, obstetrical history, physical status, lifespan, and studied cytogenetics and so on. We propose these defects were rare distal arthrogrophy genetic disease.
