Title : [Hemodynamics in venous diseases of the lower limbs].
Date : 1978
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Venous diseases of the lower extremities have been studied haemodynamically by analysis of variations in dynamic venous pressure, which is held to be a fundamental parameter. Pressure modifications point to the state of the deep venous system, the valves and the subfascial communicating veins or to the efficiency or otherwise of the muscular pump of the lower extremities. The venous pressure curve is a reliable indicator of the various clinical stages of chronic venous insufficiency and postphlebitis syndrome. As a clinical parameter, venous pressure is sensitive to all pathological changes in the venous system of the lower extremities. It presents variations proportional to the gravity of pure phlebopathies and of venous diseases secondary to congenital dysplasias (e.g. Klippel-Trenauny syndrome) and to congenital or acquired arteriovenous shunts. An attempt is made to classify venous diseases of the lower extremities on the basis of this parameter and examples are given of dynamic venous pressure curves encountered in the various disease pictures observed.
