Abstract : Musculoskeletal functions disorders may develop as a consequence of injuries and various types of congenital / acquired diseases, among which a special place belongs to muscular dystrophy. The technology with use of cells possessing myogenic potential is considered as one of the most promising approaches to solve the problem of effective restoration of skeletal muscles structure and function. In part I of the article the characteristic features, functions and phenotypic characteristics of satellite cells (SC) are reviewed as key factors of skeletal muscle tissue regeneration. Presented analysis of research results (preclinical and clinical) concerning therapeutic possibilities of technology using SC. In the second part of review will be presented data of the therapeutic use of stem cells of muscle and non-muscle origin for the treatment of skeletal muscles diseases.
