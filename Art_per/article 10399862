Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a well-known multisystem disorder with dominant inheritance. Proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) has been defined only recently, it is rather similar to but distinct from DM. Molecular genetic testing of the CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion is a reliable diagnostic method in DM. In PROMM these CTG repeats are normal, and no genetic test is so far available. Comparing the phenotypes of DM and PROMM, an important point seems to be that PROMM is a more benign disorder. There are almost no obvious mental changes in PROMM patients; premature death is extremely rare; anticipation appears to be present but to a milder degree; a severe congenital type of PROMM apparently is very rare if it occurs at all. On the other hand, at least in the German population, the frequency of PROMM may be almost equal to that of DM.
