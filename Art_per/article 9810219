Title : Trigger thumb in children--results of simple surgical treatment.
Date : 1998
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The effectiveness of simple surgical release of trigger thumb/finger in children was assessed and the onset of this condition relative to age was investigated in a retrospective study between 1977 and 1992. Referrals to the congenital hand clinic at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, were studied. A total of 53 children (68 digits) with a mean age of 1.9 years were treated during this period (as day cases). The thumb was involved in 60 digits and involvement was bilateral in 11 children. Symptoms had been present since birth in 43 children. In 51 children (96%) the trigger digit was released successfully; the 2 recurrences were due to inadequate surgical release. Trigger digit in children appears to be a congenital condition. Simple surgical release is effective treatment and can be performed on an ambulant basis.
