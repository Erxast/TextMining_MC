Abstract : Myotubular myopathy (MTM) is a severe X-linked disease without existing therapies. Here, we show that tamoxifen ameliorates MTM-related histopathological and functional abnormalities in mice, and nearly doubles survival. The beneficial effects of tamoxifen are mediated primarily via estrogen receptor signaling, as demonstrated through in vitro studies and in vivo phenotypic rescue with estradiol. RNA sequencing and protein expression analyses revealed that rescue is mediated in part through post-transcriptional reduction of dynamin-2, a known MTM modifier. These findings demonstrate an unexpected ability of tamoxifen to improve the murine MTM phenotype, providing preclinical evidence to support clinical translation.
