Abstract : Single large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions disorders are classified into three main phenotypes with frequent clinical overlap: Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome (PMS), Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) and chronic progressive external ophtalmoplegia (PEO). So far, only few anecdotal studies have reported on the urinary organic acids profile in this disease class. In this single-center retrospective study, we performed quantitative evaluation of urinary organic acids in a series of 15 pediatric patients, 7 with PMS and 8 with KSS. PMS patients showed an organic acids profile almost constantly altered, whereas KSS patients frequently presented with normal profiles. Lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, fumarate, pyruvate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, 2-ethyl-3-hydroxypropionate, and 3-methylglutaconate represented the most frequent metabolites observed in PMS urine. We also found novel metabolites, 3-methylglutarate, tiglylglycine and 2-methyl-2,3-dihydroxybutyrate, so far never reported in this disease. Interestingly, patients with a disease onset as PMS evolving overtime into KSS phenotype, presented persistent and more pronounced alterations of organic acid signature than in patients with a pure KSS phenotype. Our study shows that the quantitative analysis of urinary organic acid profile represents a helpful tool for the diagnosis of PMS and for the differential diagnosis with other inherited diseases causing abnormal organic acidurias.
