Abstract : Four cases of cheek venous malformations observed and treated in different ways are discussed by the authors. In this region angiodysplasias may cause chewing problems or an increased haemorrhagic risk during dental surgery. The therapeutic troubles are due to the muscular connections where there are many recesses and infiltration ways close to the motor and sensitive nervous trunk. Aesthetic restrictions may oblige to a minor operation or partial excision. Particular care must be taken to the lesion access. In this experience two patients have been surgically treated with venous angioma differentiation: one of these with sclerotherapy of the residual angioma As the extent of the lesion caused reconstructing problems, one patient underwent plastic surgery. The other patient was treated with sclerotherapy. After two years the patients surgically treated recovered while the patients treated with sclerotherapy turned out to be asymptomatic. In conclusion, this experience and the literature review show that the correct diagnosis and a right sclerotherapy or surgery, preventive if necessary, allow any dental surgery in due time for dental diseases without any higher haemorrhagic risk.
