Abstract : Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is a group of rare genetic muscle disorders characterized by muscle fibers with centrally located nuclei. The most common forms of CNM have been attributed to X-linked recessive mutations in the <i>MTM1</i> gene; autosomal-dominant mutations in the <i>DNM2</i> gene-encoding dynamin-2, the <i>BIN1</i> gene; and autosomal-recessive mutations in <i>BIN1</i>, <i>RYR1,</i> and <i>TTN</i> genes. Dominant CNM due to <i>DNM2</i> mutations usually follows a mild clinical course with the onset in adolescence. Currently, around 35 mutations of the <i>DNM2</i> gene have been identified in CNM; however, the underlying molecular mechanism of <i>DNM2</i> mutation in the pathology of CNM remains elusive, and the standard clinical characteristics have not yet been defined. Here, we describe the case of a 17-year-old female who presented with proximal muscle weakness along with congenital anomalous pulmonary venous connection (which has not been described in previous cases of CNM), scoliosis, and lung disease without a significant family history. Her creatine kinase level was normal. Histology, special stains, and electron microscope findings on her skeletal muscle biopsy showed CNM with the characteristic features of a <i>DNM2</i> mutation, which was later confirmed by next-generation sequencing. This case expands the known clinical and pathological findings of CNM with <i>DNM2</i> gene mutation.
