Title : Separating Larsen syndrome from the "arthrogryposis basket".
Date : 1981
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Many patients with larsen syndrome have been misdiagnosed as having arthrogryposis. Larsen syndrome should be considered in any child with multiple joint dislocations, particularly when the knees are involved. Spinal malalignment of a serious degree was encountered in five of the six patients we report and appears to have been underemphasized previously. Two of the patients had unusual ossicles of uncertain derivation at the elbow. This has been described only five times before.
