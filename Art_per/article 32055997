Abstract : Biallelic variants in TOR1AIP1, encoding the integral nuclear membrane protein LAP1 (lamina-associated polypeptide 1) with two functional isoforms LAP1B and LAP1C, have initially been linked to muscular dystrophies with variable cardiac and neurological impairment. Furthermore, a recurrent homozygous nonsense alteration, resulting in loss of both LAP1 isoforms, was identified in seven likely related individuals affected by multisystem anomalies with progeroid-like appearance and lethality within the 1st decade of life. Here, we have identified compound heterozygosity in TOR1AIP1 affecting both LAP1 isoforms in two unrelated individuals affected by congenital bilateral hearing loss, ventricular septal defect, bilateral cataracts, mild to moderate developmental delay, microcephaly, mandibular hypoplasia, short stature, progressive muscular atrophy, joint contractures and severe chronic heart failure, with much longer survival. Cellular characterization of primary fibroblasts of one affected individual revealed absence of both LAP1B and LAP1C, constitutively low lamin A/C levels, aberrant nuclear morphology including nuclear cytoplasmic channels, and premature senescence, comparable to findings in other progeroid forms of nuclear envelopathies. We additionally observed an abnormal activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2). Ectopic expression of wild-type TOR1AIP1 mitigated these cellular phenotypes, providing further evidence for the causal role of identified genetic variants. Altogether, we thus further expand the TOR1AIP1-associated phenotype by identifying individuals with biallelic loss-of-function variants who survived beyond the 1st decade of life and reveal novel molecular consequences underlying the TOR1AIP1-associated disorders.
