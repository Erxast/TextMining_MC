Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic bone formation in connective tissue and muscle in association with congenital skeletal anomalies. The disease usually leads to extensive immobility and eventual disability. We report the magnetic resonance findings in a boy prior to ossification of his soft tissue masses.
