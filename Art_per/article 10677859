Abstract : Muscle-eye-brain disease belongs to congenital muscular dystrophies with central nervous system abnormalities. The etiology of MEB is still unknown, but abnormal immunoreactivity for laminin-2 has been reported. To evaluate disease progression in muscle tissue, 32 biopsy specimens from 17 muscle-eye-brain patients were analysed. The samples of four patients were studied by immunohistochemical techniques and by quantitative Western blotting. The samples showed a great variation in the muscle pathology. Regenerative fibers and mild fiber size variation were present in over 60%. At infancy, necrotic and regenerative fibers were common, while fat infiltration was the most prominent finding in the age group over five years. In quantitative studies, the amount of laminin alpha 2 chain was clearly reduced to 10-20% of normal. In contrast, laminin beta 2 chain was overexpressed in the Western blotting studies. These findings may reflect a yet unidentified primary disturbance in the basement membrane composition and function.
