Abstract : This paper aims to evaluate adrenal gland hormone levels in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) during glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. A lower than expected basal production of cortisol was found in active and glucocorticoid-untreated PMR patients, particularly females. The abrupt onset of PMR with clinical features similar to those of the steroid-withdrawal syndrome or adrenal insufficiency, as well as the clinical response to GC therapy in elderly people already age-disposed to an inadequate adrenal and anti-inflammatory response, might represent the most significant pathophysiological basis of the disease.
