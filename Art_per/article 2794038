Title : Femoral shortening in correction of congenital knee flexion deformity with popliteal webbing.
Date : 1989 Sep-Oct
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Severe knee flexion deformity with popliteal webbing or pterygium is considered to be uncorrectable. The soft tissues and, in particular, the main nerves and vessels are short relative to the bone. Femoral shortening was used in correction of such a deformity in a child with arthrogryposis. The operative procedure is described. Femoral shortening should be considered as an aid to correction of any severe knee flexion deformity.
