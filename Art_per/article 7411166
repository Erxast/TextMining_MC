Abstract : The presence of intermediate filaments in various mature and immature eukaryotic cells is well documented. By using antibodies against the intermediate (skeletin) filaments of cow heart Purkinje fibres, we have in the present work analyzed the distribution of skeletin in normal and diseased skeletal muscle fibres. Antiskeletin proved to be a useful tool for the identification of regenerating fibres in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In mature muscle fibres with well-preserved myofibrils, skeletin had an intermyofibrillar localization at the Z-disk level where intermediate filaments were demonstrated. The presence of skeletin was also demonstrated around the rods of muscle fibres in nemaline myopathy biopsies, but the rods themselves did not show any cross-reactivity. This report exemplifies the usefulness of antibodies in muscle pathology.
