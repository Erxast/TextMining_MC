Title : Congenital myopathy with type II muscle fiber hypoplasia.
Date : 1987
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We examined a 14-month-old boy with severe muscular hypotonia and weakness. Loss of tendon reflexes were noted at age 2 months. Right-sided heart failure and dyspnea during sleep developed at age 4 months. Muscle biopsy revealed selective hypoplasia of type II fibers and normal type I fibers. Intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles showed similar changes at necropsy and probably accented the respiratory failure.
