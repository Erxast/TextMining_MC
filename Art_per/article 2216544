Title : Imaging rounds #103. Myositis ossificans in association with congenital radioulnar synostosis and congenital anterior radial head dislocation.
Date : 1990
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Although the initial trauma was minimal in this unusual case of bilateral congenital radioulnar synostosis and anterior radial head dislocation associated with myositis ossificans, a progressive decrease in elbow ROM ensued. Manipulation under general anesthesia was performed to improve flexion and extension of the involved elbow. This manipulation most likely initiated or enhanced the process of myositis ossificans in the elbow. Final treatment consisted of reassurance and active ROM exercises, with resolution of symptoms.
