Abstract : Congenital Volkmann ischemic contracture is a rare condition in which a neonate presents with an ulcerated forearm, necrotic subcutaneous tissue, nerve palsy, and muscular necrosis. We report a case of a 1-day-old infant who presented with an ulceration of the left forearm noted at delivery combined with decreased motor function of the left distal forearm. Histologic examination of the ulceration revealed findings of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn. To our knowledge, this is the first case for which the findings of subcutaneous fat necrosis have been seen histologically.
