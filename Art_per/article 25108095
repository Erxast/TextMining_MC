Date : 2014
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Complications attributed to central venous stenosis and subsequent thrombosis are increasing in frequency and are most commonly associated with neointimal fibroplasia as well as neoplastic, fibrotic, and traumatic pathologies. We present the successful venous bypass and thoracic wall reconstruction of a 58-year-old female with chronic atypical symptoms secondary to brachiocephalic vein occlusion from congenital thoracic dystrophy.
