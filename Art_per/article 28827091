Abstract : Mutations in the gene encoding comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58), also known as α β hydrolase domain-containing 5 (ABHD5), cause neutral lipid storage disorder with ichthyosis (NLSDI). This inborn error in metabolism is characterized by ectopic accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAG) within cytoplasmic lipid droplets in multiple cell types. Studies over the past decade have clearly demonstrated that CGI-58 is a potent regulator of TAG hydrolysis in the disease-relevant cell types. However, despite the reproducible genetic link between CGI-58 mutations and TAG storage, the molecular mechanisms by which CGI-58 regulates TAG hydrolysis are still incompletely understood. It is clear that CGI-58 can regulate TAG hydrolysis by activating the major TAG hydrolase adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), yet CGI-58 can also regulate lipid metabolism via mechanisms that do not involve ATGL. This review highlights recent progress made in defining the physiologic and biochemical function of CGI-58, and its broader role in energy homeostasis.
