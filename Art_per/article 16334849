Title : Difficulties with prenatal diagnosis of the Walker-Warburg syndrome.
Date : 2005
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We describe a postnatally diagnosed case of Walker-Warburg syndrome--a form of congenital muscular dystrophy with lissencephaly and eye abnormalities. We reviewed the literature to highlight its clinico-radiological diagnostic features and discuss the difficulties encountered with prenatal diagnosis, especially in cases with no positive family history. An increased awareness of this rare but lethal condition, and a high index of suspicion during routine antenatal ultrasound, could prompt further advanced fetal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, and aid in timely prenatal diagnosis, management, and counseling.
