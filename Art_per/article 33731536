Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Recessive mutations in the Myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MYL2) gene are the cause of an infantile-onset myopathy, associated with fatal myocardial disease of variable macromorphology. We here present the first Japanese family affected with recessive MYL2 myopathy. Affected siblings manifested typical features and the proband's autopsy findings were compatible with the diagnosis of noncompaction cardiomyopathy. The rapidly progressive clinical course of this recessive MYL2 cardiomyopathy highlights the crucial role of c-terminal tails in MYL2 protein in maintaining cardiac morphology and function.
