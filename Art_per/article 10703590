Abstract : To determine the direct and long-term effectivity of incision of the pulley in a trigger thumb (tendovaginitis stenosans).Retrospective study with follow-up.In the period 1984-1995, 38 children (24 boys and 14 girls) were diagnosed and operated on 45 trigger thumbs in the Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis (Amsterdam) and Medisch Centrum Alkmaar, the Netherlands. Data were obtained from notes, operation reports and review in follow-up, at least 2 years after the operation.The mean age of the children at the moment of surgery was 3 years and 2 months (range: 11 months-10.33 years). 39 out of 45 thumbs were reviewed. Four thumbs had limited postoperative function. Two of these had a revision operation. There was 1 thumb with a postoperative superficial infection. At follow-up all thumbs had maximal function. The nodule in the tendon, which was palpable in 43 out of 45 thumbs preoperatively, had (almost) disappeared in all 39 thumbs at follow-up. There was a family history of trigger thumb in 33% of the 33 patients with follow up. 18% had bilateral involvement of the thumbs. The 6 digits not included in follow-up had a normal function according to the last notes.The results of surgery in the short term are good, in the long term excellent. Few complications occur. Based on the findings, it seems advisable to operate on children with a trigger thumb if there is no spontaneous recovery within half a year. Trigger thumb is the result of a congenital tight pulley.
