Title : Three-dimensional computed tomography for maxillofacial surgery: report of cases.
Date : 1988
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Methods of three-dimensional analysis of axial computed tomographic images have recently been described. Mostly, reports have concentrated on applications relative to congenital deformities. In this report, one method of three- dimensional reformatting is reviewed. Images formed by this method have solid surface appearance and can be color enhanced and manipulated to isolate anatomic structures of interest. The program allows mathematical quantitation of tissue densities, volumes, and distances. Furthermore, models and implants can be easily made using the programs CAD-CAM ability. These images and models can be generated from data obtained on the most common CT units without any modifications. This report emphasizes maxillofacial applications other than those previously reported in the surgical and radiological literature.
