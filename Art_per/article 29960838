Abstract : Costochondral grafting (CCG) can be used for the reconstruction of ankylotic, hypoplastic, and resected temporomandibular joint (TMJ) defects. CCGs have previously been considered the gold standard in children due to their growth potential and autogenous origin, but the disadvantages are unpredictable growth and joint ankylosis. This was a retrospective study of all children who received CCGs for TMJ reconstruction from 1985 to 2004, to allow a 10-year follow-up. Fifty-five patients were included in this study, with 74 grafts being placed; their mean age was 7.9±4.2years. Infection-related ankylosis (18.2%) and craniofacial microsomia (16.4%) were the most common diagnoses. Overall, 58.2% of patients suffered one or more complications over the follow-up period, with ankylosis (32.7%) and overgrowth (16.4%) being most common. There was a significant correlation between those with infection-related ankylosis and subsequent complications (χ<sup>2</sup>=8.8, df=1, P<0.005), while ankylotic patients in general exhibited greater overall complication rates (χ<sup>2</sup>=9.0, df=1, P<0.005). Patients with congenital TMJ defects were more likely to be complication-free than those with acquired defects (χ<sup>2</sup>=4.0, df=1, P<0.05). Caution is advised when placing CCGs in paediatric patients with ankylosed TMJs, especially those with infection-related ankylosis.
