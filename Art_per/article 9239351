Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare congenital disease that affects children under the age of five years. Soft tissue swelling of the cervical and dorsal regions with local pain, warmth and low grade fever are the early clinical manifestations, usually associated with hallux valgus and microdactily of the fingers and toes. Calcifications of the fascias and muscles cause muscular contractures leading to progressive disability and restrictive lung disease. In the early stage, CT shows edema of the soft tissues and later on, calcifications of muscular fascia. The association of these radiographic and CT findings is specific and should avoid muscular biopsies which are known to be an aggravating factor in this disease.
