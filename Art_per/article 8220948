Title : T1 rho dispersion imaging of diseased muscle tissue.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : T1 rho dispersion, or the frequency dependence of T1 relaxation in the rotating frame, was used for in vivo muscle tissue characterization in 13 patients with primary skeletal muscle disease and in eight normal subjects for comparison. T1 rho dispersion measurements represent a new approach to magnetic resonance tissue characterization, possibly reflecting the macromolecular constituents of tissue. A definite, statistically significant, difference was found between the relative T1 rho dispersion values of normal and diseased muscle tissue. T1 rho dispersion measurements and images may increase the accuracy of identification of diseased muscles. Early identification of affected muscles is important for accurate diagnosis by muscle biopsy.
