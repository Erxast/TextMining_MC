Abstract : Two cases of patients suffering from the congenital form of myotonia dystrophica under going spinal surgery are presented. Both patients had major complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, postoperative wound infection and more minor complications, such as sedation and opioid sensitivity. However, the most notable complication resulting in long-term morbidity was the deterioration of bulbar muscular function in one of the patients. This resulted in recurrent aspiration pneumonia and the need for a tracheostomy. This serious complication has not previously been reported following surgery.
