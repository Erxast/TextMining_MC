Abstract : Muscle-eye-brain disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, ocular abnormalities, and brain malformation. We report an intraoperative hyperkalemic cardiac arrest following the administration of succinylcholine in a child with muscle-eye-brain disease. The disease was diagnosed only after this event. Our experience suggests that preoperative determinations of serum concentrations of lactate and creatine kinase may be useful if clinical signs consistent with myopathy are present.
