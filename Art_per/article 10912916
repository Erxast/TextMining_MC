Abstract : We have recently described an autosomal dominant hereditary inclusion body myopathy (h-IBM). Clinically it is is characterized by congenital joint contractures and slowly progressive, proximal muscle weakness and ophthalmoplegia. There is deterioration of muscle function between 30 and 50 years of age. While young patients show minor pathological changes in muscle, the middle-aged and old patients show rimmed vacuoles and inclusions of filaments measuring 15-18 nm in diameter. Except for the absence of significant inflammation the histopathology is similar to that found in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM). In s-IBM mitochondrial alterations including cytochrome c oxidase (COX) -deficient muscle fibers are common. These are due to multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. In this study we investigated the occurrence of mitochondrial alterations in autosomal dominant h-IBM. Young affected individuals showed no mitochondrial changes but three patients aged 38, 51 and 59 years, respectively, showed ragged red fibers and COX-deficient muscle fibers. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed multiple mtDNA deletions. By in situ hybridization clonal expansions of mtDNA with deletions were demonstrated in COX-deficient muscle fibers. Most of the analyzed deletion breakpoints showed nucleotide repeats flanking the deletions. The results show that COX-deficient muscle fibers and somatic mtDNA deletions are present in this family with h-IBM. The same factors may be involved in the development of mtDNA deletions in s-IBM and this family with h-IBM.
