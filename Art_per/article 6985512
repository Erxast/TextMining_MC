Title : Impending Volkmann's contracture in a newborn.
Date : 1980
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A newborn presented with severe necrosis of the volar aspect of the forearm and impending Volkmann's contracture. This is the youngest such patient reported in the literature. We suspect prolonged intrauterine pressure from an amniotic band. Such bands are known to cause constricting rings, syndactyly, and congenital amputations. If our assumption is correct, this case is unique.
