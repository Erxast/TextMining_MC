Abstract : Interventional closure of congenital ventricular septal defects (VSD) is recording a continuous rise in acceptance. Complete atrioventricular block (cAVB) and residual shunting are major concerns during follow-up, but long-term data for both are still limited. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of patients with interventional VSD closure and focused on long-term results (> 1 year follow-up). Transcatheter VSD closures were performed between 1993 and 2015, in 149 patients requiring 155 procedures (104 perimembranous, 29 muscular, 19 residual post-surgical VSDs, and 3 with multiple defects). The following devices were used: 65 × Amplatzer™ Membranous VSD Occluder, 33 × Duct Occluder II, 27 × Muscular VSD Occluder, 3 × Duct Occluder I, 24 × PFM-Nit-Occlud®, and 3 × Rashkind-Occluder. The median age at time of implantation was 6.2 (0.01-66.1) years, median height 117 (49-188) cm, and median weight 20.9 (3.2-117) kg. Median follow-up time was 6.2 (1.1-21.3) years and closure rate was 86.2% at last follow-up. Complications resulting in device explantation include one case of cAVB with a Membranous VSD occluder 7 days after implantation and four cases due to residual shunt/malposition. Six (4%) deaths occurred during follow-up with only one procedural related death from a hybrid VSD closure. Overall, our reported results of interventional VSD closure show favorable outcomes with only one (0.7%) episode of cAVB. Interventional closure offers a good alternative to surgical closure and shows improved performance by using softer devices. However, prospective long-term data in the current era with different devices are still mandatory to assess the effectiveness and safety of this procedure.
