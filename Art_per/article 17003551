Date : 2007
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Bruck syndrome is characterized by the association of arthrogryposis and osteogenesis imperfecta. It is a distinct autosomal recessive disorder associated with normal collagen I. The main features are osteoporosis, long bone bowing and scoliosis due to vertebral deformities and congenital joint contractures. We describe a French girl who was born with ankle and wrist contractures (second antenatal discovery).
