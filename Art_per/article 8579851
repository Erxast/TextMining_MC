Abstract : Cerebral cortical malformation is now diagnosed by neuroimagings, and important as a cause of developmental disorder or epilepsy. The classification of cortical malformations was tried from developmental aspect, and agyria in Miller-Dieker syndrome and polymicrogyria in Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy were compared on their pathogeneses. Unilateral hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia were reviewed on literatures.
