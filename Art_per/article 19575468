Abstract : The cardiac action potential (AP) controls the rise and fall of intracellular free Ca2+ (Ca(i)), and thus the amplitude and kinetics of force generation. Besides excitation-contraction coupling, the reverse process where Ca(i) influences the AP through Ca(i)-dependent ionic currents has been implicated as the mechanism underlying QT alternans and cardiac arrhythmias in heart failure, ischemia/reperfusion, cardiac myopathy, myocardial infarction, congenital and drug-induced long QT syndrome, and ventricular fibrillation. The development of dual optical mapping at high spatial and temporal resolution provides a powerful tool to investigate the role of Ca(i) anomalies in eliciting cardiac arrhythmias. This unit describes experimental protocols to map APs and Ca(i) transients from perfused hearts by labeling the heart with two fluorescent dyes, one to measure transmembrane potential (Vm), the other Ca(i) transients. High spatial and temporal resolution is achieved by selecting Vm and Ca(i) probes with the same excitation but different emission wavelengths, to avoid cross-talk and mechanical components.
