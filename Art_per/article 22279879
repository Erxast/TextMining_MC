Abstract : Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) is characterized by leukoencephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and gastrointestinal dysmotility. Mitochondrial myopathies are rare diseases and little is known of how to manage them when the patient requires anesthesia. We describe the anesthetic procedure used during emergency surgery for megacolon in a 26-year-old woman with MNGIE. Variables monitored were electrocardiogram, invasive arterial pressure, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure, neuromuscular block, and depth of anesthesia (entropy). Rapid sequence induction was accomplished with midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium as an alternative to succinylcholine. Anesthesia was maintained with intravenous propofol; a second dose of the neuromuscular blocker was not required. No intraoperative problems developed and extubation was possible 2 hours after arrival in the postoperative critical care unit, once we had checked the level of block to confirm that reversion was not required.
