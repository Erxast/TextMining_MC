Abstract : Interstitial deletions of the short and long arms of chromosome 5 are rare cytogenetic abnormalities. The 5p distal deletion is a genetic disorder characterized by a high-pitched cat-like cry, microcephaly, epicanthal folds, micrognathia, severe intellectual disability and motor delays. Previously, more than 46 patients with the 5q deletion have been reported. Here, we report de novo interstitial deletions involving 5p14.1-p15.2 and 5q14.3-q23.2 in a patient with multiple congenital abnormalities, including blepharophimosis, arthrogryposis, short neck, round face, pelvic kidney, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and clubfoot. The deletions were characterized using GTG banding and aCGH microarray analysis. Concurrent 5p and 5q interstitial deletions in humans have not been previously reported. We also discussed the relationship between the 5q deleted region and clubfeet.
