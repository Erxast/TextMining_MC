Abstract : A 4-month-old sexually intact male Jack Russell Terrier was evaluated because of stranguria and tenesmus. A tubular abdominal mass was palpable abdominally and rectally. Radiographic examination of the abdomen revealed a soft tissue mass located laterally and to the left of the descending colon, which was associated with extraluminal colonic obstruction and urethral compression. During abdominal exploratory surgery, a large cystic mass that was adhered to the antimesenteric border of the descending colon was removed. Porcine small intestinal submucosa was used to reinforce repair of the excision site. Histologic examination of samples of excised tissue identified normal colonic epithelium supported by submucosa and muscular tunics, which was consistent with duplication of the colon. The embryologic etiology of alimentary duplication is poorly understood, and colonic duplication is an extremely rare congenital anomaly.
