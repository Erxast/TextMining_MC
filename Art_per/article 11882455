Abstract : Congenital right ventricular muscular diverticula are extremely rare and are usually associated with other congenital cardiac anomalies, (in half of the cases tetralogy of Fallot). They functionally behave like an accessory ventricular chamber which contracts synchronously with the normal ventricles. Less than 30 patients with a right ventricular diverticulum have been reported in literature. An apical right ventricular diverticulum occurs in patients with thoraco-abdominal midline defects or abnormalities of the cardiac position([1]). However, an antero-superior diverticulum is usually associated with other congenital cardiac defects, such as a ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle and pulmonary stenosis([2--9]). We report an 11-year-old boy with an antero-superior diverticulum of the right ventricle associated with a coarctation of aorta, ductus arteriosus, and atrial and ventricular septum defects. To the best of our knowledge, such an association has not been reported before.
