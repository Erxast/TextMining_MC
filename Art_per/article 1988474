Date : 1991 Jan-Feb
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Neonatal fractures in all neonatal patients entering a spina bifida clinic over a 4-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Of six patients with fractures, all had thoracic or upper lumbar neurologic levels and all had significant contractures. The risk of fracture for patients with these two characteristics was 17%. Awareness of the risk of neonatal fracture and care in the handling of these children is stressed.
