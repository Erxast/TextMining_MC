Abstract : The study was aimed at determining the efficacy of sanatorium treatment of patients with hereditary neuromuscular abnormalities. Sanatorium methods of treatment combined with drug therapy were found to be more effective as compared with outpatient or hospital treatment. The sanatorium treatment proved most effective in children with congenital myopathy, Charcot-Marie neural amyotrophy, and Roussy-Levy polyneuropathy. Improvement in the general status and motor functions was correlated with certain improvement in dynamometric findings, locomotor tests, stabilization of a number of parameters of electroneuromyographic examination, and biochemical findings. The results point to the necessity of setting up specialized departments in childhood neurologic sanatoria or sanatoria specializing in the treatment of children with individual forms of neuromuscular diseases at health resorts which can provide treatment with sulphide waters or therapeutic mud.
