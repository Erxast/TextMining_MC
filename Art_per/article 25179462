Abstract : Nonsurgical closure of congenital ventricular septal defects (VSD) has become increasingly acceptable with the availability of different occlusion systems. Transcatheter device treatment is used for perimembranous and muscular defects. Atrio-ventricular block remains the most troublesome complication of device closure. The aim of this study was to describe our experience with closure of VSD using the Amplatzer Duct Occluder II (ADO II) as an "off-label" approach in children and adults. Between 2004 and 2012 transcatheter closure of 31 VSD (20 perimembranous, 10 muscular VSD and 1 ruptured sinus valsalva) with ADO II was undertaken in patients between 3 months and 55 years of age and with a body weight ranging from 4 to 105 kg in our institution. In 29 of 31 procedures, the defect was successfully closed (93.5%) without any significant complications. No increase of aortic or tricuspid valve regurgitation was found in any after procedure. Small residual shunts were observed immediately after the device implantation, but disappeared during a median follow-up period of 38 months (0.4-63) in 27 of 31 patients. There was no incidence of AV block or other conductance abnormalities during implantation or follow-up. The ADO II device is safe and effective for transcatheter VSD closure, but this is still an "off-label" use. After long-term follow-up in a large number of patients this device may be approved for VSD closure in the future.
