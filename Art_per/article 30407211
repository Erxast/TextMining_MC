Abstract : Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, ptosis, peripheral neuropathy and leukoencephalopathy. The diagnosis is often not made until 5-10 years after the onset of symptoms. MNGIE is caused by mutations in thymidine phosphorylase gene TYMP. Here, we present a 19-year-old boy with MNGIE who had a chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and we describe his family history. Genetic analysis revealed a novel homozygous c.765+1G>C intronic mutation which is expected to disrupt splicing of TYMP in the patient. Family screening revealed that the brother was also affected and the mother was a carrier. MNGIE should be considered and genetic testing instigated if individuals with cachexia have neuromuscular complaints or symptoms of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
