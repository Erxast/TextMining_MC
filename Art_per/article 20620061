Abstract : This study was aimed to identify Fukutin (FKTN)-related congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD) with defective alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation in Korea and to discuss their genotype-phenotype spectrum focusing on detailed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. FKTN mutations were found in nine of the 12 CMD patients with defective alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation patients (75%). Two patients were homozygous for the Japanese founder retrotransposal insertion mutation. Seven patients were heterozygous for the retrotransposal insertion mutation, five of whom carried a novel intronic mutation that activates a pseudoexon between exons 5 and 6 (c.647+2084G>T). Compared with individuals that were homozygous for the retrotransposal insertion mutation, the seven heterozygotes for the retrotransposal insertion mutation, including five patients with the novel pseudoexon mutation, exhibited a more severe clinical phenotype in terms of motor abilities and more extensive brain MRI abnormalities (i.e., a wider distribution of cortical malformation and pons and cerebellar hypoplasia). FKTN mutations are the most common genetic cause of CMD with defective alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation in Korea. Compound heterozygosity of the retrotransposal insertion and the novel pseudoexon mutation is the most prevalent genotype in Korea and is associated with a more severe clinical and radiological phenotype compared with homozygosity for the retrotransposal insertion mutation.
