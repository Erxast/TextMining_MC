Date : 1998
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Unaffected but consanguineous parents suggest autosomal recessive inheritance of a previously apparently undescribed syndrome of camptodactyly, fibrosis of the medial rectus muscle of the eye, severe myopia, facial anomalies, joint contractures, and mild scoliosis in a 13-year-old Turkish girl and her 11-year-old brother. The girl also had ptosis.
