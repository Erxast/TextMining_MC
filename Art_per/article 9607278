Abstract : Surgical technique and results of surgical correction for substantial flexion contracture of the knee in 15 children with spina bifida or other spinal conditions with lower extremities paresis is presented. Extensive posterior capsulotomy, occasionally supplemented with posterior cruciate sectioning is necessary to correct considerable flexion contracture of the knee. The technique is also effective in congenital flexion contracture with no articular surfaces deformity. Serial redressing and casting are imperative in postoperative management.
