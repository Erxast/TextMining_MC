Abstract : An ophthalmological survey of 53 cases of muscular dystrophies is presented. Patients were classified into a congenital type of dystrophies (21 cases) and a Duchenne type of dystrophies (32 cases). High incidence of myopia, weakness of the orbicularis oculi, lacking of Bell's reflex and blinking at rare intervals are found in congenital dystrophies. No pigmentary retinal degeneration was found and cataracts were rare. Atrophy of optic nerve is seen in several cases of congenital dystrophies. This fact is considered to suggest that congenital muscular dystrophies are not only a myogenic disorder but also involve the central nervous system with degenerative changes.
