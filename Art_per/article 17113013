Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We describe a patient with Becker's muscular dystrophy and cardiac failure caused by a combination of dilated cardiomyopathy and congenital bicuspid aortic valve with aortic stenosis. There is no documented association between congenital valve disease and human dystrophinopathies, and to our knowledge, this is the first reported case.
