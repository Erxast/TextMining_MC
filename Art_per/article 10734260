Abstract : Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in the Japanese population, characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy in combination with cortical dysgenesis (micropolygyria). Recently, we have identified the gene responsible for fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy on 9q31, which encodes a novel 461-amino-acid protein termed fukutin. Most Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy-bearing chromosomes are derived from a single ancestral founder (87%), and a 3 kb-retrotransposal insertion into the 3' untranslated region of this gene was found to be a founder mutation. Two independent point mutations causing premature termination confirmed that that this gene is responsible for Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy. Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy is the first human disease to be caused by an ancient retrotransposal integration. Fukutin contains an amino-terminal signal sequence, which together with results from transfection experiments suggests that it is an extracellular protein. Discovery of the Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy gene represents an important step toward greater understanding of the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies and also of normal brain development.
