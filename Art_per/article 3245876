Title : Congenital myopathy with cleft palate and increased susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia: King syndrome?
Date : 1988 Nov-Dec
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Six children of similar ethnic origin with congenital myopathy, cleft palate, malignant hyperthermia (or susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia), and skeletal anomalies are presented. The findings are remarkably consistent among our patients, 3 of whom were related. This syndrome is likely to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Children with this disorder are likely to undergo surgery with general anesthesia for facial or skeletal deformities and should be recognized as predisposed to developing malignant hyperthermia.
