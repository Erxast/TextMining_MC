Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Macrodystrophia lipomatosa is a rare nonhereditary congenital malformation that mainly affects mesenchymal structures. The pathology is associated with hypertrophic fibro-adipose tissues. One or more of the digits of the extremities are affected. This condition is previously described as macrodactyly, megalodactyly, or localized gigantism. This article describes a 48-year-old male patient who presented with the enlargement of unilateral (right) lower limb, especially of the first toe and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Although there is no clinically significant involvement of the upper extremities, bilateral cubital and unilateral carpal tunnel syndromes were also detected and macrodystrophia lipomatosa with multiple entrapment neuropathies was diagnosed in the patient.
