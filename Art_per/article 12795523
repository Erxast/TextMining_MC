Abstract : Electrodiagnostic studies are an important adjunct to the clinical examination of a patient with a suspected myopathy; however, the clinical examination is crucial in making an accurate diagnosis, because electrodiagnostic studies have only a limited role in delineating with certainty the underlying myopathic disorder. Hereditary and acquired myopathies are reviewed in this article, with particular emphasis on distinguishing clinical and electrodiagnostic features. The hereditary myopathies that are discussed include the muscular dystrophies and the congenital distal mitochondrial, and metabolic myopathies. Acquired myopathies, including inflammatory, endocrine, and toxic myopathies, as well as those associated with systemic illness, are briefly reviewed.
