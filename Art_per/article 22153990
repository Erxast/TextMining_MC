Abstract : X-linked myotubular myopathy is a predominantly severe congenital myopathy with central nuclei on muscle biopsy due to mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding myotubularin. We report a boy with typical features of X-linked myotubular myopathy. Sequencing of the MTM1 gene did not reveal any causative mutations. Subsequent MLPA analysis identified a duplication of MTM1 exon 10 both in the patient and his mother. Additional quantitative fluorescent PCR and long-range PCR revealed an additional large deletion (2536bp) within intron 10, 143bp downstream of exon 10, and confirmed the duplication of exon 10. Our findings suggest that complex rearrangements have to be considered in typically affected males with X-linked myotubular myopathy.
