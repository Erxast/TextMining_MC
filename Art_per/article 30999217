Abstract : Skeletal muscle deficiency in the 3-phosphoinositide (PtdInsP) phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1) causes myotubular myopathy which is associated with severe depression of voltage-activated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through ryanodine receptors. In the present study we aimed at further understanding how Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is altered in MTM1-deficient muscle fibers, at rest and during activation. While in wild-type muscle fibers, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release exhibits fast stereotyped kinetics of activation and decay throughout the voltage range of activation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in MTM1-deficient muscle fibers exhibits slow and unconventional kinetics at intermediate voltages, suggestive of partial loss of the normal control of ryanodine receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity. In addition, the diseased muscle fibers at rest exhibit spontaneous elementary Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events at a frequency 30 times greater than that of control fibers. Eighty percent of the events have spatiotemporal properties of archetypal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks while the rest take either the form of lower amplitude, longer duration Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events or of a combination thereof. The events occur at preferred locations in the fibers, indicating spatially uneven distribution of the parameters determining spontaneous ryanodine receptor 1 opening. Spatially large Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sources were obviously involved in some of these events, suggesting that opening of ryanodine receptors in one cluster can activate opening of ryanodine receptors in a neighboring one. Overall results demonstrate that opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated ryanodine receptors is promoted both at rest and during excitation-contraction coupling in MTM1-deficient muscle fibers. Because access to this activation mode is denied to ryanodine receptors in healthy skeletal muscle, this may play an important role in the associated disease situation.
