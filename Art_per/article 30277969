Title : Stepping Activity in Children With Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The purpose of this study was to investigate the physical activity levels in children with congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM), and to examine whether patient clinical and functional characteristics correlated to physical activity.Twenty-five children with CDM were assessed on functional measures, clinical measures, and physical activity levels.Results support that children with CDM spend the majority of their time inactive. There was a negative correlation between inactivity and cytosine-thymine-guanine repeats, suggesting increased inactivity with increased CDM severity. Age, body mass index, and lean muscle mass may be factors influencing activity levels.Children in this study received one-third the recommended steps per day. The number of steps per day is not correlated with clinical measures.
