Title : Management of facial dysmorphogenesis in nemaline myopathy: a case report.
Date : 2005
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Nemaline myopathy is a rare congenital muscle disease, which is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Both neonatal and adult onset can occur; in those with neonatal onset, the resulting muscle weakness can also afflict the facial musculature and hence influence facial growth and development. This article reports on a case in which no orthodontic intervention was undertaken during childhood and adolescence. An early decision was made to treat the facial dysmorphogenesis surgically once skeletal maturity had been reached. The authors discuss and illustrate the untreated facial growth in this condition and the surgical outcome following orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery.
