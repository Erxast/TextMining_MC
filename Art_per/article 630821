Title : Teratogenic effects in cattle of Conium maculatum and conium alkaloids and analogs.
Date : 1978
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The plant Conium maculatum produced congenital defects in calves born to cows gavaged the fresh green plant during days 50-75 of gestation. Both arthrogryposis and spinal curvature were produced and were similar to the defects produced by the piperidine alkaloid coniine. The arthrogrypotic manifestations of the condition markedly increased in severity as the animals aged. Animals gavaged dry plant had either normal or equivocally deformed offspring. A number of chain length and ring saturation analogs of coniine were not teratogenic. No congenital defects arose in offspring from maternal inhalation of either the teratogenic alkaloid coniine, or from the teratogenic green plant.
