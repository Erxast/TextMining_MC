Abstract : Serum zinc and serum copper were examined in 18 patients with the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (congenital ichthyosis, spastic di- or tetraplegia and mental retardation), in four patients with congenital ichthyosis and mental retardation, of whom three had alopecia, and in nine healthy controls. No indication of disturbed zinc or copper metabolism in these groups of patients was found.
