Abstract : Many neuromuscular disorders involve the heart, occasionally with overt clinical disease. Muscular dystrophies (dystrophinopathies, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Steinert's myotonic dystrophy), congenital myopathies, inflammatory myopathies and metabolic diseases (glycogenosis, periodic paralysis, mitochondrial diseases) may produce dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart rhythm or conduction disturbances. Furthermore the heart is commonly involved in some hereditary and degenerative diseases (Friedreich's ataxia and Kugelberg-Welander syndrome) and acquired (Guillain-Barr√© syndrome) or inherited (Refsum's disease and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome) polyneuropathies. A cardiologist's high clinical suspicion and a simple but systematic skeletal muscle and peripheral nerve investigation, including muscle enzymes quantification, neurophysiological study and muscle biopsy, are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. In selected patients, more sophisticated biochemical and genetic analysis will be necessary. In most cases, endomyocardial biopsy is not essential for the diagnosis.
