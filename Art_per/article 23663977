Title : Oligomerization of dynamin superfamily proteins in health and disease.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Proteins of the dynamin superfamily are mechanochemical GTPases, which mediate nucleotide-dependent membrane remodeling events. The founding member dynamin is recruited to the neck of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles where it oligomerizes into helical filaments. Nucleotide-hydrolysis-induced conformational changes in the oligomer catalyze scission of the vesicle neck. Here, we review recent insights into structure, function, and oligomerization of dynamin superfamily proteins and their roles in human diseases. We describe in detail the molecular mechanisms how dynamin oligomerizes at membranes and introduce a model how oligomerization is linked to membrane fission. Finally, we discuss molecular mechanisms how mutations in dynamin could lead to the congenital diseases, Centronuclear Myopathy and Charcot-Marie Tooth disease.
