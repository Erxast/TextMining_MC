Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital Volkmann ischemic contracture (CVIC) is an exceedingly rare neonatal compartment syndrome caused by intrauterine ischemia and external compression. It presents at birth with necrotic cutaneous lesions and neurologic impairment, typically in a distal upper extremity. Diagnosis and treatment are often delayed in neonates, leading to long-term neurologic sequelae. We present a rare case of CVIC in order to raise awareness of its presentation and management in hopes of improving outcomes.
