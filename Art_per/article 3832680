Title : [Etiopathology of camptodactyly (case report and literature review)].
Date : 1985 Nov-Dec
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : First, a review on the literature about camptodactyly and its pathogenesis is given. A case report is presented on a 13-year-old girl with a camptodactyly of both little fingers. Intraoperatively it was observed that the superficial flexor tendon of the right little finger ended in the palmar aponeurosis and was then found to be without function. It is our understanding that this type of anomaly of the superficial flexor tendon of the little finger as an aetiology of camptodactyly has not been reported yet in the previous literature.
