Title : Ichthyosis in the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, spastic dior tetraplegia and mental retardation. The inheritance is autosomal recessive. All 36 patients with SLS alive in Sweden in 1980 were studied with regard to ichthyosis. A slight or moderate generalized hyperkeratosis, less pronounced in the face, was already present at birth. Collodion-like membranes were never seen. The ichthyosis developed to its full extent during infancy. It was sometimes slight but most often moderate. Three types occurred in various combinations. The skin changes were concentrated in the neck, flexures and lower abdomen, in which regions the scales were often dark. The non-scaly hyperkeratosis produced characteristic and easily visible skin markings. Generalized erythema was rare, especially in adults. The DNA synthesis of the epidermis and the production of a horny layer were increased. Hair and nails were normal, as also was the ability to sweat.
