Abstract : A case of myopathy is reported in a child, first biopsied at 11/2 years of age and whose muscle showed hypotrophy of type I fibres with central nuclei. The case was followed up with another biopsy from the contralateral muscle at 6 years of age. The second sample showed only predominance of type I fibres.
