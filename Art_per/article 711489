Abstract : 30 myelomeningocele patients which were surveyed at Zurich's Children's Hospital and at the Wilhelm Schulthess Clinic in the years from 1962 to 1976 have been postexamined. Significant for the rehabilitation of these children in respect for the gaining of their best ever possible independence and capability to walk are primarily the neurosegmental level of the lesion, the remaining motor power as well as intelligence and motivation. Of secondary significance is the orthopaedic operation whereby specifically the correction of fixed deformity is important. The quantity of anesthesias should be hold at minimum, bilateral hip-dislocations can be left alone, and psoas-transfers (SHARRARD) should be made on children with strong quadriceps only.
