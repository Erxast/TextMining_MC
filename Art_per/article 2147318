Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In a retrospective review of 70 hips in 35 patients with arthrogryposis 56 of all hips studied were affected by the disorder. Clinically 4 types of arthrogrypotic hip deformity could be distinguished. In 19 hip joints not only a deformity and a restriction of movement but also a dislocation was found. Based on the results of this study a one-stage open reduction combined with a varus shortening, femoral derotation osteotomy for unilateral hip dislocations is recommended. In cases of bilateral dislocations the above mentioned surgical procedure is indicated only if there is a less severe generalized involvement of AMC. For correction of hip deformities type II during neonatal period conservative treatment by traction or by plaster cast redression has proved be successful. The authors experience is compared with reports of other authors and guidelines for clinical classification and treatment are presented.
