Abstract : Neck masses are a common finding in children and can present a difficult diagnostic challenge. These masses may represent a variety of conditions having a congenital, acquired inflammatory, neoplastic, or vascular origin. The fascial spaces and compartments of the neck provide an approach to differential diagnosis, and extensive knowledge of the anatomy and contents of each cervical compartment is mandatory in the diagnosis of pediatric neck lesions. Several imaging techniques, including radiography, gray-scale and Doppler ultrasonography, conventional and three-dimensional computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and MR angiography, have been proposed for the evaluation of such lesions, and each has its own advantages and limitations. The imaging findings in 120 children who had been referred or treated for cervical lesions were retrospectively reviewed, and a systematic multimodality imaging approach to pediatric neck lesions based on the involvement of anatomic compartments of the cervical region was developed to increase diagnostic efficiency. Careful attention to clinical history and physical examination findings, along with knowledge of the embryologic features and anatomy of the cervical region and a multimodality imaging approach, is very helpful in the diagnosis and management of pediatric neck lesions.
