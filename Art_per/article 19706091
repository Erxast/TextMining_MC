Abstract : Speckled lentiginous nevus syndrome is a recently described neurocutaneous disorder characterized by speckled lentiginous nevus in association with hyperhidrosis, skin dysesthesia, and muscular weakness in an ipsilateral manner. We report a 9-year-old boy with a large speckled lentiginous nevus on his trunk, bilateral upper extremities, and neck associated with hyperhidrosis and nonspecific pain in the distribution of the nevus in addition to prominent upper extremity asymmetry and scoliosis. Similar musculoskeletal abnormalities have been reported in patients with phacomatosis pigmentovascularis and phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica which feature speckled lentiginous nevus; however, this patient demonstrates striking musculoskeletal abnormalities in the absence of coexisting vascular lesions or nevus sebaceous.
