Date : 2013
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The Mediterranean countries are distinguished with their peculiar genetic pool and diversities. Recessive diseases often present with their own founder mutations. In some instances this is shared with neighboring populations. Dominant disorders in the area are increasingly recognized as health care providing systems and technology improve. Among muscular dystrophies Duchenne and Becker types constitute the major fraction in almost all societies. This is followed by various forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Congenital dystrophies and other related rare types are a matter of recognition. The identification and registry of facio-scapulo-humeral and myotonic dystrophies vary in different states.
