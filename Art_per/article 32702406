Abstract : Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is a rare connective tissue disorder, associated with heterozygous mutations in the FBN2 gene. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of an intragenic deletion encompassing exons 1-8 of FBN2 gene in Israeli population.A search for intragenic FBN2 microdeletions was performed in two databases of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) - genetic laboratory of a tertiary medical center (the primary cohort) and one of the largest Israeli health maintenance organizations (replication cohort).Overall, 52,879 microarray tests were searched for FBN2 microdeletions. The primary cohort constituted of 18,301 CMA tests, among which 33 intragenic FBN2 microdeletions in unrelated individuals were found (0.18%). Prenatal prevalence of this variant was 0.23% (28/12,604), and specifically in low risk pregnancies - 0.29% (22/7464). Of the 28 cases with known parental origin, 27 (96.4%) were of full or partial Ashkenazi Jewish ethnic background. The approximate allele incidence in the Ashkenazi Jewish origin was 0.4% (18/4961). Combined with the 34,578 CMA tests in the replication cohort, the overall frequency of FBN2 microdeletions was 0.24% (125/52,879). None of the pre- or postnatal cases had any clinical manifestations of CCA.Intragenic FBN2 microdeletions are found in one of every 420 CMA analyses in Israeli population, and in particular one of every 340 low-risk pregnancies. Due to high allele incidence in Ashkenazi Jewish population (1:275), we suggest that FBN2 gene deletion detected by CMA among Ashkenazi Jews should be interpreted as benign copy number variant.
