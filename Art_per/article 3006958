Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Extraarticular wrist syndromes are relatively common causes of underperformance or nonparticipation in sports. Many of these conditions may be caused by nonathletic activities. The spectrum of pathologic signs ranges from tendon inflammation, stenosis, and subluxation to neuropathies, vascular conditions, congenital anomalies, cysts, calcarea, and callosities. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and specific measures directed toward the condition. Moreover, many of these problems may be preventable by modification of sports equipment, proper conditioning, alteration of athletic techniques or habits, and various orthoses.
