Abstract : For better cosmetic appearance, attempts to reduce the number of laparoscopic wounds have been sought. Investigators have thus begun to carry out procedures through a single incision or natural orifice endoscopic surgery instead of using conventional laparoscopic surgery. The authors here describe transumbilical single-incision hybrid transperineal laparoscopic surgery as a novel approach for vaginoplasty using a sigmoid graft.From August 2010 to October 2012, 15 young females with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome underwent laparoscopic sigmoid vaginosplasty using a combined transumbilical single-incision and transperineal approach. A multichannel single port was placed through the umbilical incision for the main laparoscopic procedures. A 12-mm trocar as an assisting working port was inserted into the pelvic cavity through the transvaginal dimple between the rectum and urethra.A functioning vagina 12-15 cm in length and approximately 4 cm in width was created in all the patients. The average operative time and hospital stay were 151.5±34.2 minutes and 7.4±3.2 days, respectively. The only perioperative complications were 1 case of stress ulcer and 1 case with umbilical infection. All patients were satisfied with the surgery, and 12 of them had subsequent sexual activity.Transumbilical single-incision hybrid transperineal laparoscopic sigmoid vaginoplasty offers a feasible scarless approach for females with MRKH syndrome. The favorable cosmetic results would favor use of this type of vaginoplasty as an alternative to the conventional laparoscopic approach.
