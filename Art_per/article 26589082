Date : 2015
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Treatment of myelomeningocele and arthrogrypotic foot deformities has been controversial; many different procedures have been advocated for each type of deformity. In most cases, outcomes have had variable success rates, and many complications can occur. Treatment strategies should highlight care that avoids the development of a stiffened foot and allows for a variety of options to regain correction when a relapse occurs. This is particularly true in myelomeningocele, whereby a stiff foot runs a high risk for skin ulceration, leading to osteomyelitis. Discussion includes appropriate circumstances for the use of presented procedures and the author's preferred treatment for each deformity.
