Abstract : Minicore, multicore, core-targetoid and other ultrastructural lesions were found in the paraspinal muscles of patients with AS. The 10 patients studied, all men with AS, showed varying degrees of muscle fibre atrophy, Z band streaming, rod body formation, minicores, multicores and core-targetoid fibres. Central core disease, rod body myopathy, minicore and multicore diseases are recognized clinical entities within the congenital group of structural myopathies. Target fibres are believed to be a feature of reinnervation. It is also known that experimental tenotomy causes core-targetoid changes, rod bodies, minicores and multicores. Therefore, it seems possible that tension is a necessary stimulus for the correct programming of synthetic muscle enzymes, and without this disorganization occurs. It may also be assumed, but in this case for genetic reasons, that similar biochemical systems are disturbed in the group of congenital myopathies.
