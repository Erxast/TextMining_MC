Title : [Progressive myositis ossificans--a case report].
Date : 1989
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case of myositis ossificans in a 28 year old male is reported. He had been found to have ossification of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle at birth. Subsequently both thighs, abdominal muscles of the right side and facial muscles on both sides were similarly affected. X-ray findings, biopsied specimens and biochemical changes were in accord with those reported in the literature, though involvement of facial muscles and the heart had not been previously reported. The presence of several congenital malformations gives support to the important role of heredity in the pathogenesis of this disease. EHDB brought some relief in this case, and may be of prophylactic value in the prevention of ossification due to postoperative trauma of a planned temporo-mandibular operation.
