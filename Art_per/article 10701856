Abstract : The mutation specific for myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an unstable expanded CTG repeat located in the 3'-untranslated region of the myotonin protein kinase gene. Expansion of the CTG repeat shows a positive correlation with the severity of the disease and increases in successive generations of DM patients. Children with the congenital form of DM show the most severe phenotype and have large expansions, usually > 1000 repeats. For pregnant women with DM, prenatal diagnosis of DM may be offered. To reduce the time between chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis and final results of DNA analysis in these cases, a fast and efficient method has been developed. This method combines direct PCR analyses for normal alleles with a nested PCR system followed by non-radioactive hybridization with a single-stranded probe.
