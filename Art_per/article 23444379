Abstract : A-type lamins are components of the nuclear lamina, a filamentous network of the nuclear envelope in metazoans that supports nuclear architecture. In addition, lamin A/C can also be found in the interior of the nucleus. This nucleoplasmic lamin pool is soluble in physiological buffer, depends on the presence of the lamin-binding protein, lamina-associated polypeptide 2α (LAP2α) and regulates cell cycle progression in tissue progenitor cells. ΔK32 mutations in A-type lamins cause severe congenital muscle disease in humans and a muscle maturation defect in Lmna(ΔK32/ΔK32) knock-in mice. Mutant ΔK32 lamin A/C protein levels were reduced and all mutant lamin A/C was soluble and mislocalized to the nucleoplasm. To test the role of LAP2α in nucleoplasmic ΔK32 lamin A/C regulation and functions, we deleted LAP2α in Lmna(ΔK32/ΔK32) knock-in mice. In double mutant mice the Lmna(ΔK32/ΔK32)-linked muscle defect was unaffected. LAP2α interacted with mutant lamin A/C, but unlike wild-type lamin A/C, the intranuclear localization of ΔK32 lamin A/C was not affected by loss of LAP2α. In contrast, loss of LAP2α in Lmna(ΔK32/ΔK32) mice impaired the regulation of tissue progenitor cells as in lamin A/C wild-type animals. These data indicate that a LAP2α-independent assembly defect of ΔK32 lamin A/C is the predominant cause of the mouse pathology, whereas the LAP2α-linked functions of nucleoplasmic lamin A/C in the regulation of tissue progenitor cells are not affected in Lmna(ΔK32/ΔK32) mice.
