Abstract : With the use of mathematical models it was attempted to calculate the probability of eugenic or dysgenic effects as a consequence of medical treatment and of procedures used in human genetics. 1. Modern medicine will cause mainly an increase in multifactorial malformations and diseases. But the resulting burden for the general public most probably will be considerably smaller compared to to-day expenses for the care of those affected with chronic inherited diseases. 2. For many families concerned prenatal diagnosis is the only reasonable approach to obtain healthy children of their own. In order to reduce substantially the number of affected individuals prenatal diagnosis would have to be applied as a prospective mass screening which in many cases would be too demanding.
