Abstract : This article describes the complex orthodontic treatment of a 22-year-old patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and macroglossia. His orthodontic treatment hinged on providing proper informed consent and management of the malocclusion with glossectomy, extractions, fixed appliances, and elastics. Challenges to traditional treatment are outlined, and compromises to both process and outcome are discussed from an informed consent point of view because of the serious risks involved. The treatment objectives were met, and the outcome was considered a success.
