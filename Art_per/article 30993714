Abstract : Very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency (VLCADD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acids are a major source of energy during catabolic stress, so the absence of VLCAD can result in a metabolic crises and respiratory insufficiency. The etiology of this respiratory insufficiency is unclear. Thus, our aims were: (1) to characterize respiratory pathophysiology in VLCADD mice (VLCAD<sup>-/-</sup> ), and (2) to determine if AAV9-mediated gene therapy improves respiratory function. For the first aim, VLCAD<sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice underwent an exercise/fast "stress protocol" and awake spontaneous breathing was evaluated using whole-body plethysmography (WBP) both at baseline and during a hypercapnic respiratory challenge (FiO<sub>2</sub> : 0.21; FiCO<sub>2</sub> : 0.07; nitrogen balance). During hypercapnia, VLCAD <sup>-/-</sup> mice had a significantly lower frequency, tidal volume, minute ventilation, and peak inspiratory and expiratory flow, all of which indicate respiratory insufficiency. Histologically, the cardiac and respiratory muscles of stressed VLCAD <sup>-/-</sup> animals had an accumulation of intramyocellular lipids. For the second aim, a single systemic injection of AAV9-VLCAD gene therapy improved this respiratory pathology by normalizing breathing frequency and enhancing peak inspiratory flow. In addition, following gene therapy, there was a moderate reduction of lipid accumulation in the respiratory muscles. Furthermore, VLCAD protein expression was robust in cardiac and respiratory muscle. This was confirmed by immuno-staining with anti-human VLCAD antibody. In summary, stress with exercise and fasting induces respiratory insufficiency in VLCAD<sup>-/-</sup> mice and a single injection with AAV9-VLCAD gene therapy ameliorates breathing.
