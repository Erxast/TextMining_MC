Abstract : A pilot population-based carrier screening program started in 2010 in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada, for four recessive diseases with local founder effects (tyrosinemia type I, autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, congenital lactic acidosis, and Andermann syndrome).The objective of this study was to describe the experience of carrier couples identified through this program.Semi-structured interviews were performed with carrier couples. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was performed to identify emerging themes.Interviews were performed with 15 carrier couples (56% response rate). Carrier couples had little knowledge about the target diseases before being identified as carriers, despite pre-test education sessions. The main motivation for screening was a recommendation by a peer who had been screened, even for those with a positive family history of one of the target conditions. Couples perceived themselves at low risk of being a carrier couple, whatever their family history. Being found to be a carrier couple was initially a shock, illustrating how ill prepared they were for such a result, but carrier couples appreciated knowing their status.Our results emphasize the informational needs of couples to make informed decisions and the importance of post-test counseling for those with positive results. Our findings can inform counseling procedures in expanded carrier screening. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
