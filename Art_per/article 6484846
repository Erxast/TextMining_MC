Abstract : As part of the diagnostic workup following an episode of fetal loss, it is generally recommended that fetal tissue be submitted for chromosome analysis and that the fetus be photographed and radiographed. Our recent clinical experience has suggested that, in those fetuses where size is compatible, xeroradiography may be superior to standard radiography. Xeroradiography utilizes principles similar to those in film radiology, with low-energy photon beams and relatively long exposure times. The physical characteristics of the beam and imaging system provide optimal soft tissue visualization. We have found this technique to be of use in studying a broad variety of abortuses with abnormalities. Examples of fetal abnormalities in which we have used this technique include acardia, neural tube defects, nuchal cystic hygroma, and arthrogryposis. In fetuses weighing 500-1,000 gm, the exposure settings are 25 MA, 1 second, 40 KVP. For larger fetuses the KVP should be increased by 1 or 2. This technique has not been useful for a complete body view of large fetuses due to the size limitations of the xeroradiographic cassette itself.
