Abstract : In children, fibromatoses are fairly uncommon tumours assuming a variety of forms, whilst cutaneous fibromas are rarely found. Recognisable histologically by varied degrees of proliferation of fibroblasts and collagenous fibres, they present a very varied clinical and evolutive picture. A description is given of a case corresponding to "progressive ossifying myositis" and a criticism made of this designation which includes a condition which is not myositis at all but rather an ossifying fibromatosis.
