Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two cases of congenital isolated hypertrophy of the left upper limb with different hand deformities are described. A 4-year-old girl had splayed fingers and an abducted thumb due to anomalous muscles. Excision of these muscles corrected the deformity. The other, an 8-year-old boy, had severe ulnar drift of the fingers (windblown-like hand). He had corrective osteotomies of the second and third metarcarpals and reconstruction of the collateral ligaments. The deformity was corrected and at the latest follow up there was with no recurrence of the deviation. Both cases regained good hand function.
