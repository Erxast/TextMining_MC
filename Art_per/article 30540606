Abstract : Congenital vertical talus (CVT) is a rare rigid flatfoot disorder with a rocker-bottom flatfoot appearance. It is characterized by hindfoot valgus and equinus, with associated midfoot dorsiflexion and forefoot abduction. We describe a patient who was born with dysmorphic features and subsequently was diagnosed with Beals contractural arachnodactyly. After the diagnosis of bilateral CVT was made, it was treated with a single-stage open reduction. There was a unilateral recurrence, which was treated with revision surgery. The patient had an excellent functional outcome.CVT often requires surgical management and may recur. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CVT associated with Beals contractural arachnodactyly.
