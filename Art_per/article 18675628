Title : Congenital alveolar fusion.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital fusion of the jaws is rare. It may be unilateral or bilateral and may involve only the soft tissues or both the hard and soft tissues. This anomaly may be seen separately or in association with other syndromes. Congenital alveolar fusion restricts mouth opening, causing problems with feeding, swallowing, and respiration. Case 1 had membranous bands between the alveoli that required tracheostomy for stabilization, followed by osteotomy for release. Postoperatively, both patients had adequate mouth opening.
