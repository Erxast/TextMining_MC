Abstract : We report the case of a 3-year-old Japanese boy with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) deficiency (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man entry 311800). The patient had anaemia and jaundice at birth, necessitating exchange transfusions for 2 d. After one red blood cell transfusion at age 2 months, his Hb level was 8-9 g/dl, his reticulocyte counts were 300-500 x 109/l, and his total bilirubin level was 25.65-42.75 micro mol/l. The patient suffered two episodes of respiratory infection-associated haemolytic crisis and rhabdomyolysis during early infancy. At age 3.0 years, his developmental milestones (developmental quotients measured using the Tsumori-Inage methods) score was 49% (normal 74-131%), and his height was below average by -2.0 standard deviations. The diagnosis of PGK1 deficiency was made based on his remarkably low (< 10% of normal) erythrocyte PGK enzyme activity level and the identification of a novel missense (1060G-->C) PGK1 gene mutation. This mutation results in the Ala-353Pro amino acid substitution, which has been designated PGK Kyoto. The patient developed the full clinical symptoms of PGK1 deficiency including haemolytic anaemia, myopathy, central nervous system disorder and growth retardation, which is unusual.
