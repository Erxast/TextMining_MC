Abstract : Congenital muscular dystrophies are characterised by progressive skeletal muscle weakness from birth or early infancy. Maternal respiratory compromise, joint contractures and presence of spinal instrumentation or fusion are some of the anaesthetic challenges that may be encountered in the obstetric setting. The choice of anaesthetic technique for surgical delivery needs to be considered on an individual basis. Multidisciplinary involvement is paramount to optimise peripartum care and outcomes. In this case report, we present the use of dexmedetomidine, humidified high-flow nasal oxygen, rocuronium and sugammadex in the anaesthetic management of a wheelchair-bound, non-invasive bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation-dependent parturient with congenital muscular dystrophy, who was presenting for caesarean section.
