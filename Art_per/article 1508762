Date : 1992 Mar-Apr
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors describe the case of a twelve-year-old patient presenting early autism associated with congenital muscular dystrophy--subtype IV, according to the subclassification of Fukuyama (slight mental retardation, ability to walk, muscle pseudohypertrophy). To our knowledge, this association has never been reported. Several factors may have played a causative role in the development of an autistic disorder in the patient. The authors suggest the following as the most significant ones: disharmonious personality, weak emotional structure, inadequate primary relation with the mother, poor environmental influences, frustrations encountered because of the muscular disorder.
