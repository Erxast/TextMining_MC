Abstract : Left coronary artery compression syndrome is an uncommon entity and characterized by compression of the LMCA in-between the aorta and an enlarged main pulmonary arterial trunk. It is usually associated with a congenital cardiac defect. Cardiac 64-slice MDCT provides a non-invasive and an accurate method for assessing the degree of dynamic LMCA compression throughout the cardiac cycle, its angulation relative to the left sinus of Valsalva and depiction of pulmonary pathology, making it a valuable tool in the workup of patients suspected of left coronary artery compression.
