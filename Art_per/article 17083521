Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital afibrinogenaemia is a rare bleeding disorder characterized by absence of fibrinogen and varying bleeding tendency. Treatment with fibrinogen concentrates is considered to be the best choice for afibrinogenaemic patients who experience bleeding. We report the case of a 22-year-old Greek patient who presented with large muscular haematomas and was treated with fibrinogen concentrates. The efficacy of this treatment and the problems that arose during his hospitalization are being discussed.
