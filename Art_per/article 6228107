Abstract : The muscle spindle in the preterm infants with congenital myotonic dystrophy consisted of numerous, unfused intrafusal fibers. These fibers showed immature myofilament arrangement at 27 weeks but had the nuclear arrangement of bag and chain type. The motor endings were very sparse while prominent sensory endings were seen. At 34-37 weeks, even though the muscle fibers were unfused, the nuclear bag and chain fibers could be differentiated by the presence and absence of M line. Immature motor endings were seen at this stage. In conclusion, the muscle spindle in the preterm infants is immature.
