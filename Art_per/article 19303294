Abstract : Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene have been associated with a wide range of phenotypes including the malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility trait, Central Core Disease (CCD) and other congenital myopathies characterized by early onset and predominant proximal weakness. We report a patient presenting at 77 years with a predominant axial myopathy associated with prominent involvement of spine extensors, confirmed on MRI and muscle biopsy, compatible with a core myopathy. RYR1 mutational analysis revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.119G>T; p.Gly40Val) affecting the RYR1 N-terminus, previously predominantly associated with MH susceptibility. This case expands the spectrum of RYR1-related phenotypes and suggests that MH-related RYR1 mutations may give rise to overt neuromuscular symptoms later in life, with clinical features not typically found in CCD due to C-terminal hotspot mutations. Late-onset congenital myopathies may be under-recognised and diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion.
