Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy is the commonest inherited muscle disease of adults. It causes significant clinical features in many organ systems and requires a broad-based approach for optimum management. Recent genetic advances promise to provide exciting new insights into the pathophysiology of the disease and may allow rational treatments to be developed.
