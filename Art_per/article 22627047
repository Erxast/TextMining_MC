Abstract : Bovine congenital pseudomyotonia (PMT) is a genetic disease in Chianina and other breeds of cattle that induces muscular stiffness. PMT in the Chianina breed is caused by a missense mutation in exon 6 of the ATP2A1 gene, which encodes the SERCA1 pump. In this study, the prevalence of PMT carriers and the frequency of the deleterious PMT allele in selected subpopulations of the Chianina breed were estimated. The prevalence of PMT carriers among ranked Chianina sires used for artificial insemination in the years 2007-2011 was 13.6%. The frequency of PMT carriers in young bull calves born in the period January 2007 to June 2011 selected for a performance testing programme was 13.4%. Selective breeding against this genetic defect is restricted to males only and therefore is predicted to require at least seven generations to eradicate PMT.
