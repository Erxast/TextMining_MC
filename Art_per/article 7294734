Title : Vitamin E deficiency in Werdnig-Hoffmann disease.
Date : 1981
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Vitamin E levels were measured in the plasma of infants and children with various neuromuscular disorders. Seven of 8 infants with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease (WHD) had a significantly lower plasma vitamin E level (p less than 0.01) than age-matched normal controls, children with congenital myopathies, or children with muscular dystrophy. Vitamin E deficiency in WHD is not caused by malabsorption. A therapeutic trial of vitamin E in 3 patients with WHD did not change the natural course of the disease. Vitamin E deficiency may play a role in the pathogenesis of WHD.
