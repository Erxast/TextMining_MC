Abstract : Seven patients with Treacher-Collins syndrome were studied. All of patients were children or teenagers. Helical CT scanner (Toshiba) was used to reconstruct zygomatic arch and temporomandibular joint capsule on lateral aspect of temporal bone in five patients of microtia and atresia of both ears and two patients of narrow ear canals of both ears without microtia.Three-dimensional reconstructions of computed tomography on lateral aspect of temporal bone demonstrated various congenital abnormality including aplasia of zygomatic arch in seven patients and dislocation of temporomandibular joint capsule in seven patients.
