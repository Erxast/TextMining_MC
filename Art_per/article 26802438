Abstract : Multiminicore disease is a congenital myopathy characterized pathologically by the presence of multiple minicore structures in the sarcoplasm. Mutations in the selenoprotein N1-encoding gene (SEPN1) and ryanodine receptor 1-encoding gene (RYR1) are responsible for half of the reported cases. Mutations in multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 10-encoding gene (MEGF10) have been identified only recently in a few patients with antenatal to infantile-onset myopathy, with and without minicore pathology.We report 2 sisters with adult-onset respiratory insufficiency followed by development of limb weakness. Both had scoliosis, distal joint hyperlaxity, and high-arched feet.A biopsy of the right triceps muscle in 1 sister showed multiple minicore structures. She had electromyographic changes of myopathy with fibrillation potentials and myotonic discharges. Next generation sequencing identified novel compound heterozygous missense variants in MEGF10 c.230G>A (p.Arg77Gln) and c.1833T>G (p.Cys611Trp) in both sisters.MEGF10 mutations can cause myopathy with adult-onset respiratory insufficiency.
