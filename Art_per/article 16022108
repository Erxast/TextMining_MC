Title : [Functional condition of the myocardium after reparative heart surgeries].
Date : 2005
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors of the article analyze the dynamics of the myocardial pumping ability after surgical repair of congenital and acquired heart valvular diseases. Measurement of the intracardial and central hemodynamics allowed the authors to demonstrate the significance of the diastolic component of heart functioning and the subendocardial circulation condition in the development of preclinical heart failure. The study shows a clear interrelation between myocardial functional load and increase of catecholamine concentration in it. An abrupt fall of norepinephrine concentration in the myocardium suggests an extreme overload of the sympathico-adrenal system and its exhaustion, caused by extremal functioning conditions.
