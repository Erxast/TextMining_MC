Abstract : A 27-month-old girl with a history of congenital myopathy presented with two indurated, pink plaques involving the right arm and left thigh. Closer examination identified central puncta within these plaques, which reportedly occurred at sites of witnessed arachnid bites. After confirmation of the spider species as Trachelas tranquillus, she was treated to address cutaneous inflammation and suspected superinfection using oral and topical antibiotics as well as topical corticosteroid resulting in prompt resolution of her lesions. Trachelas tranquillus should be considered as a possible source of inflammatory spider bites that can become superinfected.
