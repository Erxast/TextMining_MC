Abstract : Hypoglycosylation and reduced laminin-binding activity of alpha-dystroglycan are common characteristics of dystroglycanopathy, which is a group of congenital and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. We previously identified the genes for Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) and muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB). FCMD, caused by a mutation in the fukutin gene, is a severe form of dystroglycanopathy. Knock-in mice carrying the founder retrotransposal insertion exhibited hypoglycosylated alpha-dystroglycan; however, no signs of muscular dystrophy were observed. More sensitive methods detected minor levels of intact alpha-dystroglycan, and solid-phase assays determined laminin binding levels to be approximately 50% of normal. In contrast, intact alpha-dystroglycan is undetectable in the dystrophic Large mouse, and laminin-binding activity is markedly reduced. These data indicate that a small amount of intact alpha-dystroglycan is sufficient to maintain muscle cell integrity in knock-in mice, suggesting that the treatment of dystroglycanopathies might not require the full recovery of glycosylation. Transfer of fukutin into knock-in mice restored glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Transfer of LARGE produced laminin-binding forms of alpha-dystroglycan in both knock-in mice and the POMGnT1 mutant mouse. These data suggest that even partial restoration of alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin-binding activity by replacing or augmenting glycosylation-related genes might effectively deter dystroglycanopathy progression and thus provide therapeutic benefits.
