Title : Congenital myopathy with focal loss of cross-striations revisited.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In 1977 Wijngaarden et al. reported a Dutch family with a congenital myopathy characterized by external ophthalmoplegia and a remarkable histological feature, focal loss of cross-striations. A small number of other families with similar clinical and pathological features led to the consideration of this congenital myopathy as a distinct entity. Here we present more than 30years of follow-up from the Dutch family and report recently identified compound heterozygous mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, c.10627-2A>G and p.Arg3539His (c.10616G>A). Focal loss of cross-striations on muscle biopsy is another histopathological feature that should raise the possibility of RYR1 involvement.
