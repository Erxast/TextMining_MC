Abstract : Thorough non-invasive cardiovascular studies were conducted in a series of ten gamma-sarcoglycanopathy Gypsy patients with the founder C283Y mutation in 13q12. Results were compared with those obtained in an age-matched group of normal boys and girls. The studies included electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluations using pulsed wave Doppler tissue imaging to assess regional diastolic function and myocardial velocities at various levels. This study confirms the significant electrocardiographic abnormalities described in previous studies. Furthermore, measurement of myocardial velocity at different levels demonstrated an abnormal relaxation pattern in the tricuspid annulus in four of the oldest patients, which strongly suggests intrinsic myocardial involvement of the right ventricle. To our knowledge, these specific studies have not been previously performed in a clinically and genetically homogeneous group of gamma-sarcoglycanopathy patients and suggest primary myocardial involvement probably due to gamma-sarcoglycan deficiency in cardiac muscle fibres. Our results could be of interest in the follow-up of these patients and the prevention and treatment of late cardiological complications.
