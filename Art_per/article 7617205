Date : 1995
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report the clinical and electrophysiologic data on five subjects from two families with severe sensory and autonomic neuropathy who also exhibited peroneal muscular atrophy with the electrophysiologic features of an axonopathy, congenital cataracts, mental retardation, and skin lesions. One patient had hearing loss. Autosomal recessive inheritance was probable in both families.
