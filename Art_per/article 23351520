Abstract : The diaphragm is the main muscle involved in ventilation and is supplied exclusively by the phrenic nerves. Congenital defects of the diaphragm muscle or phrenic nerve injury cause diaphragmatic paralysis-eventration. Prognosis and treatment depend on whether involvement is unilateral or bilateral and on the patient's previous clinical status. In addition, the diaphragm is an anatomical barrier between the thoracic and abdominal cavities and is traversed by the esophagus and important vascular and nerve structures. Abnormal dilation of the natural orifices of the diaphragm or loss of its continuity can cause abdominal structures to pass into the chest cavity, an occurrence known as diaphragmatic hernias. According to their etiology, hernias are divided into congenital, acquired and traumatic. Clinical manifestations, prognosis and treatment depend mainly on hernia size and age at diagnosis. Like any muscle, the diaphragm can develop benign or malignant primary tumors. However, diaphragm involvement due to tumors arising in adjacent organs is much more common. The prognosis is good in benign primary tumors and poor in both primary and secondary malignant tumors. This article reviews the main anatomical and physiological characteristics of the diaphragm, routes of surgical access and the most frequent diseases affecting this structure.
