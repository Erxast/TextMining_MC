Abstract : Myositis ossificans progressiva is an unusual autosomal-dominant inherited disease characterized by congenital malformations and osseous metaplasia of the fascia of the muscles and connective tissue leading to ossification of the relevant area. The case report is remarkable in that eight members of the same family over five generations manifested the exclusive localization of the disease in the maxillofacial region.
