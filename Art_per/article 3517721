Title : Myotonic dystrophy and pregnancy: a review.
Date : 1986
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The previous reports of 20 women with myotonic dystrophy and pregnancy are reviewed, and a new case report added. Myotonic dystrophy is often unrecognized in early life due to vague symptoms, and is often first diagnosed during pregnancy which is known to worsen the main features of muscular weakness and myotonia. Complications of pregnancy and delivery are frequent and serious and should be known to all those dealing with pregnant women. A history of fetal wastage or a child suffering from symptoms of congenital myotonic dystrophy may be a clue to the diagnosis and these patients should be closely followed until safe delivery. The neonatologist should be involved as feeding and respiratory problems in the neonate may indicate that the infant is affected.
