Abstract : A fresh isolate of Akabane virus was inoculated intravenously into 11 seronegative pregnant cows at 62 to 96 days of gestation. Two of the cows were slaughtered 18 days post-inoculation, and the fetuses were examined; the remaining cows were allowed to give birth. All the inoculated cows developed viremia and neutralizing antibody for the virus, indicating that the cows were actually infected with the virus, although fever or any other clinical abnormalities were not noted. The virus further infected the fetuses. This was proved by virus isolation in one of the two fetuses from the slaughtered cows, and polymyositis was noted in both fetuses. Six of seven calves born alive had anti-Akabane antibody in their precolostral sera, indicating that in utero infection with the virus took place in these calves. Some of the in utero-infected calves demonstrated congenital abnormalities such as cerebral defect, hydranencephaly, and arthrogryposis. These findings provide additional evidence that Akabane virus is the etiological agent of epizootic abortion and congenital arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome in cattle.
