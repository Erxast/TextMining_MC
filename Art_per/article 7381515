Abstract : Congenital Fiber Type Disproportion (CFTD) has recently been described as a consistent and stereotyped clinicopathological entity, including congenital nonprogressive hypotonia and weakness, contractures, kyphoscoliosis, high arched palate, dislocated hips, short stature, and feet deformities. Our personal experience with this condition suggests a wider disparity in the physical appearance and associated abnormalities of affected individuals than the well-defined clinical syndrome previously described. We are presenting 5 cases, including 2 siblings, whose muscle biopsies satisfy the major histological and statistical criteria for the diagnosis. Although each child clearly had hypotonia and weakness consistent with a congenital myopathy, only 3 had a sufficient number of other similarities to establish the diagnosis clinically. The clinical spectrum of the other cases ranged from one infant whose only abnormality was mild hypotonia in the legs to another whose problems included severe motor impairment, marked mental retardation, growth failure, frontal bossing, abnormal hair, and scoliosis. Even in retrospect, the diagnosis of CFTD could not have been supported on clinical grounds alone. Therefore, CFTD is a congenital myopathy whose diagnosis can be made only by muscle biopsy, rather than a distinct syndrome whose diagnosis can be assumed on the basis of clinical characteristics alone.
