Abstract : Pearson syndrome (PS) is a rare mitochondrial disorder that usually presents with transfusion-dependent macrocytic anemia, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and lactic acidosis. Typical bone marrow (BM) features are vacuolization in hematopoietic progenitors, hypocellularity, and ringed sideroblasts. At the neonatal age, PS may have a variable clinical onset. Moreover, there is little information about BM features at this age and the timing of their presentation. We report a neonatal case of PS that presented with refractory anemia and atypical BM features. We reviewed the BM findings in neonatal-onset PS cases to stress the importance and limitations of BM evaluation at this age.
