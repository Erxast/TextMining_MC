Abstract : PIEZO2 encodes a mechanically activated cation channel, which is abundantly expressed in dorsal root ganglion neuron and sensory endings of proprioceptors required for light touch sensation and proprioception in mice. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in PIEZO2 (i.e., PIEZO2 deficiency) were recently found to cause an arthrogryposis syndrome. Sixteen patients from eight families have been reported to date. Herein we report a new case, including detailed clinical characteristics and courses as well as comprehensive neurological features. The patient was a 12-year-old girl presenting with congenital multiple contractures, progressive severe scoliosis, prenatal-onset growth impairment, motor developmental delay with hypotonia and myopathy-like muscle pathology, mild facial features, and normal intelligence. Her neurological features included areflexia, impaired proprioception, and decreased senses. Neurophysiological examination revealed decreased amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials, absent H reflex, and prolongation of central conduction times. Clinical exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous frameshift mutation in PIEZO2 (NM_022068: c.4171_4174delGTCA: p.Val1391Lysfs*39) with no detectable mRNA expression of the gene. PIEZO2 deficiency represents a clinical entity involving characteristic neuromuscular abnormalities and physical features. Next generation sequencing-based comprehensive molecular screening and extensive neurophysiological examination could be valuable for diagnosis of the disorder.
