Abstract : Diffuse spinal arachnoiditis in neurobrucellosis is a rare manifestation. We report a boy aged 17, presenting with hearing impairment and recurrent vomiting for 18 months, weight loss for 12 months, dysphagia, dysarthria, hypophonia for 6 months, and gait unsteadiness for 5 months. He had bilateral 5th (motor) to 12th cranial nerve palsy, wasting and weakness of limbs, fasciculations, absent tendon reflexes, and positive Babinski's sign. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed raised protein and pleocytosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive enhancing exudates in cisterns and post-contrast enhancement of bilateral 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th nerves. Spine showed clumping with contrast enhancement of the cauda equina roots and encasement of the cord with exudates. Serum and CSF were positive for anti-<i>Brucella</i> antibodies. He showed significant improvement with antibiotics. At 4 months follow-up, MRI demonstrated near complete resolution of cranial and spinal arachnoiditis. It is important to recognize such rare atypical presentations of neurobrucellosis.
