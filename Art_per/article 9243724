Date : 1997 Mar-Apr
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Aino virus (JaNAr 28 strain), a possible agent of a congenital anomaly of calves, was inoculated into the yolk sac of chick embryos at a dose of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4) or 10(5) TCID50 0.2 ml-1 at four, six or eight days of incubation. At 21 days of incubation all the unhatched embryos or hatched chickens in the experimental and control groups were sacrificed for pathological examination. The incidence of hydranencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia or agenesis and arthrogryposis or scoliosis was highest (85 per cent in the chicks inoculated with 10(3) TCID50 0.2 ml-1 at eight days of incubation. The lesions were very similar to those found in congenital abnormalities in calves suspected of a natural infection with Aino virus.
