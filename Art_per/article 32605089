Abstract : We identified the known c.1_9del mutation in the <i>PLEC</i> gene in four unrelated females from consanguineous families of Turkish origin. All individuals presented with slowly progressive limb-girdle weakness without any dermatological findings, and dystrophic changes observed in their muscle biopsies. Additionally, the neurological examination revealed ptosis, facial weakness, fatigability, and muscle cramps in all four cases. In two patients, repetitive nerve stimulation showed a borderline decrement and a high jitter was detected in all patients by single-fiber electromyography. Clinical improvement was observed after treatment with pyridostigmine and salbutamol was started. We further characterize the phenotype of patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R17 clinically, by muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and by describing a common 3.8 Mb haplotype in three individuals from the same geographical region. In addition, we review the neuromuscular symptoms associated with <i>PLEC</i> mutations and the role of plectin in the neuromuscular junction.
