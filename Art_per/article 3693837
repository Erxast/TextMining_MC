Abstract : Twenty-four patients with camptodactyly of their small fingers were treated with a dynamic splint. Most of the patients could extend the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints within a few months by using the dynamic splint 24 hours a day. After almost full extension of the proximal interphalangeal joint was achieved, splinting for 8 hours a day produced good final results. However, after the splint was removed, contracture tended to recur. Although further studies are needed to determine the optimum termination of treatment, in our opinion it should be when the growth plate is closed, and longitudinal growth of the finger no longer occurs.
