Abstract : Myofibrillar myopathy is characterized by nonhyaline and hyaline lesions due to mutations in nuclear genes encoding for extra-myofibrillar or myofibrillar proteins. Cardiac involvement in myofibrillar myopathy may be phenotypically expressed as dilated, hypertrophic, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation and flutter has so far not been reported in myofibrillar myopathy. We report the case of a young female with myofibrillar myopathy and deteriorating heart failure due to restrictive cardiomyopathy and recurrent atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardias intolerant to pharmacotherapy. Cardiac arrhythmias were successfully treated with repeat radiofrequency ablations and resulted in regression of heart failure, thus postponing the necessity for cardiac transplantation.
