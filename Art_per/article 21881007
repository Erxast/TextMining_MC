Abstract : Myotubular myopathy is a rare congenital disease characterized by hypotonia and respiratory compromise at birth in affected males. It causes high neonatal mortality. Most surviving newborns need prolonged ventilation and have significantly delayed motor development. Although all patients with congenital myotubular myopathy have respiratory problems such as atelectasis and recurrent lung infections, concurrent neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis is rare. We report a newborn with a myotubular myopathy, ventilator dependency, recurrent lung infections and pleural effusion, facial diplegia, ophthalmoplegia, and progressive intrahepatic cholestasis. A genetic study showed a novel mutation of the MTM1gene: c.1142 G>A (R381Q). We suggest that physicians consider probable concurrent disorders of other organs in neonates with congenital myotubular myopathy.
