Abstract : Neonatal hypotonia is frequently observed with a highly variable clinical presentation. Congenital myopathies that are classically characterized by the presence of structural changes of the muscle fibres such as cores, rods and aggregates have been reported to be occasionally associated with this presentation. However, the identification of the causing defect can be a challenging task in severe neonatal forms of the disease since specific structural changes might not always be present in affected newborn's muscles. The RYR1 gene encodes the skeletal muscle isoform of a calcium channel, the ryanodine receptor, and has been involved in both dominant and recessive congenital myopathies associated with structural changes and presenting with various degree of severity. Here we report the case of a child presenting at birth with a lethal form of neonatal hypotonia associated with an atypical congenital myopathy. Molecular investigations showed that the disease was caused by two novel RYR1 mutations. One of the mutations was a large-sized genomic deletion. This is the first genomic rearrangement identified into the RYR1 gene to our knowledge. This new class of mutation of the RYR1 gene will clearly have consequences for the molecular investigation of RYR1-related diseases.
