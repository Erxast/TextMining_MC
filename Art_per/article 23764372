Abstract : Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is often due to inactivating variants in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene causing chronically elevated plasma calcium levels with inappropriately normal or elevated parathyroid hormone levels. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the state of hyperparathyroid hypercalcemia is associated with reduced muscle strength and impaired quality of life (QoL).To study whether FHH affects muscle function, postural stability, and QoL.In a cross-sectional study, we investigated muscle strength (handgrip, elbow flexion/extension, and knee flexion/extension), balance function, physical activity, and QoL in 50 patients with FHH and in a similar number of age- and gender-matched population-based healthy controls. All but one of the FHH cases had genetically verified inactivating variants in the CASR gene.Studied subjects (n=100, 68% females) had a mean age of 56.0 years. Muscle strength as assessed by measuring maximum force and maximum force production did not differ between the groups. Neither did groups differ in terms of QoL, physical activity, or postural stability, as assessed during normal standing with eyes open, normal standing with eyes closed, semi-tandem standing, or tandem standing. Adjustment for vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels) and BMI did not change results.Despite a state of chronic hypercalcemia, muscle strength, balance function, and QoL are not impaired in patients with FHH. Our findings are reassuring for patients with FHH as they should not be considered as having a severe disease.
