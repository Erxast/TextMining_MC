Title : Lower abdominal wall reconstruction using the anterior thigh fasciocutaneous flap.
Date : 1999
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Full thickness defects of the lower abdominal wall are uncommon. They can occur in congenital abdominal wall defects, acute trauma and following resection of soft tissue tumours. In reconstruction of defects not amenable to primary closure, three problems need to be addressed: (i) the fascial layer needs to be reconstructed; (ii) stable and sensate skin coverage is needed as the lower abdominal waistline area is subject to pressure; (iii) it is desirable to restore the contour of the abdominal wall. We present a case with a large area of radiation dermatitis and recurrence of a malignant ovarian tumour in the lower abdominal wall. After en bloc resection the 25 x 6 cm lower abdominal defect was reconstructed with a sensate anterior thigh fasciocutaneous flap. The vascular supply was reliable and the outcome was good. The reasons for using this fasciocutaneous flap in preference to the other options are discussed.
