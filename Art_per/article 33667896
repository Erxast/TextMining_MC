Abstract : With the exception of infantile spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and congenital myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1), congenital myopathies and muscular dystrophies with neonatal respiratory distress pose diagnostic challenges. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides hope for the diagnosis of these rare diseases. We evaluated the efficiency of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in ventilated newborns with peripheral hypotonia. We compared the results of our previous study in a cohort of 19 patients analysed by Sanger sequencing from 2007 to 2012, with a diagnostic yield of 26% (5/19), and those of a new retrospective study in 28 patients from 2007 to 2018 diagnosed using MyoPanel, a neuromuscular disease panel, with a diagnostic yield of 43% (12/28 patients). Pathogenic variants were found in five genes: ACTA1 (n = 4 patients), RYR1 (n = 2), CACNA1S (n = 1), NEB (n = 3), and MTM1 (n = 2). Myopanel increased the diagnosis of congenital neuromuscular diseases, but more than half the patients remained undiagnosed. Whole exome sequencing did not seem to fully respond to this diagnostic limitation. Therefore, explorations with whole genome sequencing will be the next step.
