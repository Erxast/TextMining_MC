Abstract : Pathogenic mutations in DPAGT1 cause a rare type of a congenital disorder of glycosylation termed DPAGT1-CDG or, alternatively, a milder version with only myasthenia known as DPAGT1-CMS. Fourteen disease-causing mutations in 28 patients from 10 families have previously been reported to cause the systemic form, DPAGT1-CDG. We here report on another 11 patients from 8 families and add 10 new mutations. Most patients have a very severe disease course, where common findings are pronounced muscular hypotonia, intractable epilepsy, global developmental delay/intellectual disability, and early death. We also present data on three affected females that are young adults and have a somewhat milder, stable disease. Our findings expand both the molecular and clinical knowledge of previously published data but also widen the phenotypic spectrum of DPAGT1-CDG.
