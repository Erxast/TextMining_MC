Abstract : Arthrogryposis is a rare congenital syndrome, characterised by multiple joint contractures. Children suffering from this disease often need surgical interventions to correct musculoskeletal abnormalities. Among problems which may be encountered are a difficult airway, myopathy, difficulties with peripheral iv placement, and the possibility of  intraoperative hyperthermia.  In three described cases, we used thiopentone and cis-atracurium to induce anaesthesia, which was then maintained with nitrous-oxide and fentanyl. In one case sevoflurane was also used. No problems with intubation or hyperthermia were encountered.
