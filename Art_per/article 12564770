Abstract : A sporadic case of congenital myopathy had severe muscle weakness of neonatal onset. Nemaline and cytoplasmic bodies were detected in muscle biopsies taken at 4 months of age. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of nemaline myopathy (severe neonatal form). The simultaneous and abundant presence of these two types of sarcoplasmic inclusion has been found in only a few cases. However, these cases suggest that the sarcoplasmic inclusions may be formed, at least partially, by common mechanisms.
