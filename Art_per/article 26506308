Abstract : Nucleus positioning is key for intracellular organization, cell differentiation, and organ development and is affected in many diseases, including myopathies due to alteration in amphiphysin-2 (BIN1). The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are essential for nucleus positioning, but their crosstalk in this process is sparsely characterized. Here, we report that impairment of amphiphysin/BIN1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, mammalian cells, or muscles from patients with centronuclear myopathy alters nuclear position and shape. We show that AMPH-1/BIN1 binds to nesprin and actin, as well as to the microtubule-binding protein CLIP170 in both species. Expression of the microtubule-anchoring CAP-GLY domain of CLIP170 fused to the nuclear-envelope-anchoring KASH domain of nesprin rescues nuclear positioning defects of amph-1 mutants. Amphiphysins thus play a central role in linking the nuclear envelope with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. We propose that BIN1 has a direct and evolutionarily conserved role in nuclear positioning, altered in myopathies.
