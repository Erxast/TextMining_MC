Abstract : Although X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a recessive disorder, heterozygous female carriers of MTM1 mutations may present with limb girdle and facial weakness. It is proposed that manifesting heterozygote females with XLMTM have a skewed pattern of X-chromosome inactivation. However, skewed X-chromosome inactivation was not detected in either the lymphocyte or muscle DNA of a woman who presented with limb girdle/facial weakness and was found to be heterozygous for the R224X mutation.
