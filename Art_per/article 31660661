Abstract : We present eight families with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and myopathy bearing a TTN intron 213 extended splice-site variant (NM_001267550.1:c.39974-11T>G), inherited in trans with a second pathogenic TTN variant. Muscle-derived RNA studies of three individuals confirmed mis-splicing induced by the c.39974-11T>G variant; in-frame exon 214 skipping or use of a cryptic 3' splice-site effecting a frameshift. Confounding interpretation of pathogenicity is the absence of exons 213-217 within the described skeletal muscle TTN N2A isoform. However, RNA-sequencing from 365 adult human gastrocnemius samples revealed that 56% specimens predominantly include exons 213-217 in TTN transcripts (inclusion rate â‰¥66%). Further, RNA-sequencing of five fetal muscle samples confirmed that 4/5 specimens predominantly include exons 213-217 (fifth sample inclusion rate 57%). Contractures improved significantly with age for four individuals, which may be linked to decreased expression of pathogenic fetal transcripts. Our study extends emerging evidence supporting a vital developmental role for TTN isoforms containing metatranscript-only exons.
