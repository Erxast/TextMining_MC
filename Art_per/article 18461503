Abstract : Nemaline myopathies (NM) are a rare group of muscle disorders, but represent one of the most common forms of congenital myopathy. The clinical picture ranges from severe muscular hypotonia often leading to death during childhood to mild forms with long life expectancy. Diagnosis is made by muscle biopsy showing characteristic sarcoplasmic and sometimes intranuclear rod bodies. So far, disease-associated mutations have been detected in six genes without any simple correlation between genotype and phenotype or histological findings. We report a patient with a phenotype typical of congenital onset nemaline myopathy and exclusively intranuclear rods. Mutation analysis revealed a new heterozygous missense mutation in exon 3 of the ACTA1 gene (Q139H). Molecular modelling predicts that substitution of Q139 for H139 alters the amino acid side chains and hydrogen bonding which may alter the nucleotide binding cleft by adding 'bulk' to the mutated molecule. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates that mutant actin Q139H is expressed at approximately half the level of wild-type actin in the patient's muscle. We speculate that these alterations, although not directly affecting the nuclear export signal, negatively interfere with the nuclear export of the mutated protein and thereby cause retention of mutant actin and intranuclear rod formation.
