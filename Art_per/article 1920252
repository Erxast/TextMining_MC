Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A polysystemic disorder was observed in three related English Springer Spaniel dogs that demonstrated regurgitation from an early age, slowly progressive temporal muscle atrophy with partial trismus, and less pronounced generalized skeletal muscle atrophy. All dogs exhibited moderate dyserythropoietic anemia, polymyopathy with megaesophagus, and varying degrees of cardiomegaly. The prevalence, etiology, underlying pathomechanism, and possible mode of inheritance remain to be elucidated.
