Abstract : We aimed to provide proof-of-principle evidence that intensive home-based speech treatment can improve dysarthria in complex multisystemic degenerative ataxias, exemplified by autosomal recessive spastic ataxia Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). Feasibility and piloting efficacy of speech training specifically tailored to cerebellar dysarthria was examined through a 4-week program in seven patients with rater-blinded assessment of intelligibility (primary outcome) and naturalness and acoustic measures of speech (secondary outcomes) performed 4 weeks before, immediately prior to, and directly after training (intraindividual control design). Speech intelligibility and naturalness improved post treatment. This provides piloting evidence that ataxia-tailored speech treatment might be effective in degenerative cerebellar disease.
