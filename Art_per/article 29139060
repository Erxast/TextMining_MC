Abstract : Sideroblastic anemias are anemic disorders characterized by the presence of ring sideroblasts in a patient's bone marrow. These disorders are typically divided into two types, congenital or acquired sideroblastic anemia. Recently, several genes were reported as responsible for congenital sideroblastic anemia; however, the relationship between the function of the gene products and ring sideroblasts is largely unclear. In this review article, we will focus on the iron metabolism in erythroid cells as well as in patients with congenital sideroblastic anemia.
