Title : Computational analysis of a novel SACS gene mutation with BioExtract server.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay is a distinct form of hereditary early-onset spastic ataxia caused by cerebellum and spinal cord degeneration. The SACS gene has been demonstrated to be responsible for the disease through worldwide description of different mutations. We report here a computational analysis of a novel SACS gene mutation identified in a Tunisian family, using workflow implemented on the BioExtract Server. Several online computational tools are currently available to explore the effect of novel identified mutations in human and other organisms. Such analysis is time-consuming and generates a batch of files that researchers need to extract and save. The BioExtract Server workflow described here offers an easy way to execute the required tools together, avoiding entering queries independently in each web tool or service.
