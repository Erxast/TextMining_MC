Abstract : Technical advances continue to expand the number of genetic disorders that can be diagnosed in utero. The current methods for prenatal diagnosis are as follows: Amniocentesis, fetoscopy, fetal blood sampling, biopsy of fetal skin, and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). The method for growing fetal cells obtained by amniocentesis in short term culture and karyotyping has opened a new area to chromosomal anomalies. By using cultured amniotic fluid cells in larger numbers, it is also possible to diagnose many metabolic disorders. Fetoscopy has been developed which permits the perinatologist to enter the uterus and obtain tissue sample or to actually view the fetus. However, it is very difficult to visualize the fetus directly through fetoscope. Only specific parts of the fetus can be readily identified, but a total examination of surface anatomy is rarely possible. Now ultrasonography with improved resolution can clearly define many major anatomical abnormalities without apparent risk. And also, fetal blood sampling and skin biopsy have been successfully performed under ultrasound guidance rather than under direct fetoscopic visualization. Recently, the advent of fetal blood sampling has made it possible to diagnose genetic disorders which have hitherto been impossible to recognize in the fetus. The main applications are for the prenatal diagnosis of the fetal infection, coagulopathies, hemoglobinopathies, and muscular dystrophies. Several severe genodermatoses result in early death or are associated with significant morbidity. Some of these disorders can be diagnosed in utero with skin biopsies. Harlequin Ichthyosis is a typical case. A positive prenatal diagnosis of Harlequin Ichthyosis was reported.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
