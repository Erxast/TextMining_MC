Abstract : Introduction Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the more common congenital heart defects, and aortic regurgitation (AR) is its major complication if it remains unrepaired. We aim to determine the AR incidence in various types of VSD, its immediate and intermediate six to 12-month post-VSD repair outcomes of AR. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of all children aged 18 years or younger who were diagnosed with single VSD at our institution from 2016 to 2018. VSD was classified according to its location and relation to the tricuspid annulus and semilunar valve. AR severity grading was done according to the American Society of Echocardiography, and vena contracta width (VC) was taken as the main parameter for severity. We defined trivial-to-mild AR as VC width less than 0.3 cm, moderate AR was 0.3-0.6 cm VC width, and severe AR was VC width of more than 0.6 cm. Immediate and intermediate outcomes of surgical closure, such as residual VSD and AR, were observed. Results One hundred ninety patients with isolated single VSD were included in the study. Of those, 114 patients had perimembranous VSD (60.0%), 64 patients had muscular VSD (33.7%), and 12 patients had supracristal VSD (6.3%). The median age of our study cohort was six months, with a male to female ratio of 1.3:1. Aortic valve prolapse (28.9%; n = 55) and AR (23.2%; n = 44) were the most common findings on echocardiographic evaluation of VSD patients. Most cases of VSD with AR had trivial-to-mild AR, (68.2%; n = 30). AR was most commonly seen in supracristal VSD (83.3%; n = 10) followed by perimembranous VSD (28.9%; n = 33). VSD closed spontaneously in 34 patients (17.9%) and 98 patients (51.6%) patients underwent surgery. Residual VSD after surgical closure was present in 57.1% (56) and 17.3% (17) of the patients immediate postoperatively and six- to 12-month postoperative follow-up, respectively. Similarly, residual AR after surgical closure of VSD was present in 32.7% (32) and 15.3% (15) of the patients immediate postoperatively and six- to 12-month postoperative follow-up, respectively. Conclusion The incidence of AR with VSD was very high in our study; AR was most commonly associated with supracristal VSD. After surgical repair, mild AR decreased with time. Early corrective surgery of VSD can prevent this complication and help improve outcomes.
