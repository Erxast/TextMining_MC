Abstract : Sternocleidomastoid tumor of infancy (SCMTI), also known as fibromatosis colli or muscular torticollis, is the most common cause of congenital torticollis. It is present in approximately 0.4% of live births, and usually 90% of patients will have a good prognosis if therapy is initiated and continued for the appropriate period of time. This paper presents two cases of SCMTI and explains the diagnostic modalities and treatment options for this entity. SCMTI should be diagnosed early in the infant's life, since early detection and initiation of conservative treatment leads to resolution of the disease in the majority of patients.
