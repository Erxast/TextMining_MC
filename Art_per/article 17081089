Abstract : Isolated ventricular septal defect is the most common form of congenital heart disease. Surgery has been performed for many years and is considered the gold standard for the treatment of ventricular septal defects. However, it is associated with morbidity and mortality. Less invasive techniques have been developed and currently percutaneous closure of muscular and perimembranous ventricular septal defects has to be considered a possible alternative to the standard surgical approach.
