Abstract : Centronuclear myopathy (CNM), a subtype of congenital myopathy (CM), is a group of clinical and genetically heterogeneous muscle disorders. Since the discovery of the SPEG gene and disease-causing variants, only a few additional patients have been reported.The child, a 13-year-old female, had delayed motor development since childhood, weakness of both lower extremities for 10 years, gait swinging, and a positive Gower sign. Her distal muscle strength of both lower extremities was grade IV. The electromyography showed myogenic damage and electromyographic changes. Her 11-year-old sister had a similar muscle weakness phenotype. Gene sequencing revealed that both sisters had SPEG compound heterozygous mutations, and the mutation sites were c.3715 + 4C > T and c.3588delC, which were derived from their parents. These variant sites have not been reported before. The muscle biopsy showed the nucleic (> 20% of fibers) were located in the center of the cell, the average diameter of type I myofibers was slightly smaller than that of type II myofibers, and the pathology of type I myofibers was dominant, which agreed with the pathological changes of centronuclear myopathy.The clinical phenotypes of CNM patients caused by mutations at different sites of the SPEG gene are also different. In this case, there was no cardiomyopathy. This study expanded the number of CNM cases and the mutation spectrum of the SPEG gene to provide references for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling.
