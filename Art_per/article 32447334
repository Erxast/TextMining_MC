Abstract : Background Fatty acid β-oxidation disorders (FAODs) include more than 15 distinct disorders and have a wide variety of symptoms, usually not evident between episodes of acute decompensation. After the introduction of newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), early identification of FAODs has become feasible. We analyzed the MS/MS results in Tianjin, China during a six-year period to evaluate the incidence, disease spectrum, and genetic characteristics of FAODs. Methods We analyzed the MS/MS results for screening FAODs from May 2013 to December 2018 in Tianjin, China. Infants with positive screening results were confirmed through next-generation sequencing and validated by Sanger sequencing. Results A total of 220,443 infants were screened and 25 FAODs patients were identified (1:8,817). Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) with an incidence rate up to 1:20,040 was the most common disorder among all FAODs. Recurrent mutations of relatively common diseases, like PCD and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD), were identified. During the follow-up, two patients suffered from sudden death due to carnitine palmitoyl transferase-Ⅱ deficiency (CPT Ⅱ) and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD). Conclusion Our data indicated that FAODs are relatively common in Tianjin and may even cause infant death in certain cases. The elucidated disease spectrum and genetic backgrounds elucidated in this study may contribute to the treatment and prenatal genetic counseling of FAODs.
