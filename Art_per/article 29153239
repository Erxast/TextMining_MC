Date : 2018
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital deformities of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) complex can present as a heterogeneous continuum of growth disturbances of the mandibular condyle, articular eminence, and temporal bone. This article describes several syndromes with congenital condylar deformity, including mandibulofacial dysostosis (Treacher Collins syndrome), hemifacial microsomia, oculoauriculovertebral syndrome, oculomandibulodyscephaly (Hallermann-Streiff syndrome), and Nager syndrome. Variations in the extent of TMJ deficiency seen in each individual case influence the timing and techniques of TMJ reconstruction.
