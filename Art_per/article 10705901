Abstract : MACROPHAGIC MYOFASCIITIS: A most unusual inflammatory myopathy, first described by Germmad had been reported with increasing frequency since 1993 in the leading French myopathology centers. We present our experience with this new disease: macrophagic myofasciitis.By November 1999, 70 cases of macrophagic myofasciitis had been recorded since our first description. The first 22 patients (sex ratio M/F = 1:3) referred with the presumptive diagnosis of polymyositis (n = 11), polymyalgia rheumatica (n = 5), mitochondrial cytopathy (n = 4), and congenital myopathy or muscle dystrophy (n = 1 each). Symptoms included myalgia (91%), anthralgia (68%), marked asthenia (55%), muscle weakness (45%), and fever (32%).Abnormal laboratory findings included elevated CK levels (50%), markedly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37%), and myopathic EMG (35%). Muscle biopsy showed a unique myopathological pattern characterized by: i) centripetal infiltration of epimysium, perimysium and perifascicular endomysium by sheets of large cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (CD68+, CD1a-, S100-, with a PAS-positive content; ii) absence of necrosis, of both epithelioid and giant cells, and of mitotic figures; iii) presence of occasional CD8+ T-cells; iv) inconspicuous muscle fiber damage. The picture was easily distinguishable from sarcoid myopathy and fasciitis-panniculitis syndromes. The infectious diseases know to be associated with reactive histiocytes, including Whipple√≠s disease, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare infection and malakoplakia, could not be documented. Patients improved under corticosteroid therapy and/or immunomodulatory therapeuticA new inflammatory muscle disorder, characterized by a distinctive pathological pattern of macrophagic myofasciitis is emerging in France.
