Abstract : Sporadic late onset nemaline myopathy (SLONM) is a rare, intractable acquired myopathy that is characterised by progressive muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline rods in myofibres. Unlike the congenital form of nemaline myopathy (NM), there are only few case reports and series on SLONM in the scientific literature. We present a case report of SLONM in a 62-year-old male from a rural town in Western Australia, without any of the conditions often associated with SLONM such as monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance or HIV infection. SLONM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of progressive proximal muscle weakness in an adult.
