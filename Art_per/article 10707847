Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Immunohistochemical reactivity for utrophin has been recorded in 45 biopsies from patients with various neuromuscular diseases. The upregulation of utrophin on the extrajunctional sarcolemma has been found in dystrophinopathies, other muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, inflammatory myopathies, neurogenic muscle disorders (diabetic neuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophies), minimal change myopathies as well as in some normal biopsies.
