Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Localized myopathy of the muscular layers may be an important factor contributing to segmental dilatation of the intestine (SDI). Only one report has described SDI of the jejunum in a neonate showing no abnormality of the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). The present report describes the very rare case of a neonatal girl with segmental dilatation of the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum with irregular arrangements of Auerbach's plexus and ICC and the successful surgical treatment of SDI. We review the literature on this type of relationship between abnormality of ICC and SDI and discuss the clinical features of this complication. Furthermore, the possible neuropathic cause of SDI complicated with disorders of ICC was explored in this report.
