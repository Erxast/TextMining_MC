Abstract : The diagnostic clarification of low back pain from the orthopedic point of view requires a specific exploration of the clinical history and an exact elicitation of findings not only of the vertebral column but also of the hip joints and the lower extremities. In the differential diagnosis of the disease processes which must be considered, congenital deformities, disturbances of statics and functional muscular states, inflammatory, degenerative, metabolic, tumorous and post-traumatic changes of the vertebral column must be demarcated from diseases of other etiology.
