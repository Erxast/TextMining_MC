Abstract : We encountered a fetal pig with eventration of the diaphragm and pulmonary hypoplasia accompanied by phrenic nerve agenesis. The fetal pig was female measuring 34 cm in crown-rump length and about 1500 g in body weight. The diaphragm was a complete continuous sheet, but comprised a translucent membrane with residual muscular tissue only at the dorsolateral area of the right leaf of the diaphragm. The left leaf protruded extraordinarily toward the thoracic cavity. The left phrenic nerve was completely absent, while there was a slight remnant of the right phrenic nerve that supplied the dorsolateral muscular area of the right leaf. Both lungs were small, and the number of smaller bronchioles arising from the bronchioles was decreased to about half of that of the normal lung. Additionally, the right and left subclavius muscles and nerves could not be identified. These findings imply that the diaphragm, the subclavius muscle and nerves innervating them comprise a developmental module, which would secondarily affect lung development. It is considered that the present case is analogous to the animal model of congenital eventration of the diaphragm in humans.
