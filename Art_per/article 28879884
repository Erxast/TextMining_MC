Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder leading to progressive weakness of muscles caused due to dysfunction in or lack of protein in muscle cells. The prevalence of muscular dystrophy has been observed globally and is becoming a critical area of study for better health services. The purpose of the study is to analyze the research strength of muscular dystrophy using bibliographic literature. A quantitative literature analysis was carried out on muscular dystrophy from 1991 to 2015 for assessing the global research trends. This literature-based study was conducted using the documents retrieved from the Science Citation Index using the keywords: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD), Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD), Myotonic Dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy, Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy, and Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. Analysis was done for annual productivity of publication, authorship, collaboration, country performance, citation frequency, characteristics of most cited document, journal productivity, etc.
