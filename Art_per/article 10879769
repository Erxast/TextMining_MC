Date : 2000
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors report the case of a 27-year-old woman with an arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) associated with atlantoaxial subluxation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of its kind. The authors review the literature with reference to dysraphic abnormalities associated with atlantoaxial subluxation and with AMC. The patient presented with severe tetraparesis following a minor traffic accident. She underwent a procedure in which transoral decompression and dorsal stabilization were performed and, postoperatively, made a good clinical outcome. The authors stress the need for diagnostic neuroimaging of the craniocervical junction in patients with AMC.
