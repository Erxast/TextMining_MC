Abstract : A 32-year-old adult case of glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCK) is reported. He had brain and muscle atrophy, probably due to congenital malformation. Progressive renal failure developed and he died. Autopsy disclosed multiple tiny cysts exclusively in the renal cortices. Microscopic study revealed that the cysts were dilated Bowman's spaces. This case is the 12th adult case reported in the world.
