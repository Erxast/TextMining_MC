Abstract : Restrictive dermopathy (RD) is a rare lethal autosomal recessive genodermatosis, characterized by abnormally rigid skin with prominent superficial vasculature, erosions and epidermal hyperkeratosis, dysplastic clavicles, joint contractures, mouth fixed in the 'O' position, small pinched nose, and neonatal death. Mutations of ZMPSTE24 and LMNA genes are reported as the causes of RD, with those of ZMPSTE24 being more prevalent. Here, we report on a familial c.50delA (p.Lys17Serfs*21) mutation of the ZMPSTE24 gene, causing RD in two siblings.
