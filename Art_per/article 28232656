Abstract : The mammalian neuromuscular junction(NMJ), a cholinergic synapse between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle fiber, is essential for neural control of muscle contraction. Impaired formation and/or maintenance of NMJs results in disorders of neuromuscular transmission such as myasthenia gravis(MG)and congenital myasthenic syndromes(CMSs). The formation and maintenance of NMJs are orchestrated by the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK. Activation of MuSK involves its essential cytoplasmic activator Dok-7, the MuSK co-receptor Lrp4, and the motor neuron-derived MuSK activator agrin. Indeed, CMS-associated mutations are identified in the genes encoding these 4 proteins, and autoantibodies against MuSK, Lrp4, or agrin are found in MG patients, demonstrating the pathophysiological significance of the MuSK activation machinery. However, Lrp4 and agrin also play crucial roles separate from MuSK activation in NMJ formation and maintenance. Based on the finding that forced expression of Dok-7 in muscle activates MuSK and enlarges NMJs, we recently developed DOK7 gene therapy as a therapy aimed at enlarging the NMJ, which has potential for treating various neuromuscular disorders with defective NMJ structure.
