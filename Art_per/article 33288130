Abstract : Colorectal disease profiles for children in low- and middle-income settings (LMIC) are characterized by late presentation, increased complications and limited follow-up in many cases. There is a high prevalence of infectious conditions causing secondary colorectal disease such as Mycobacterium Tuberculosis(TB), Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV) and Human Papilloma Virus(HPV), which also impact the management of other primary colorectal conditions, such as wound-healing and intestinal anastomosis. Perineal trauma from sexual assault, motor vehicle or pedestrian accidents, burns, and traditional enemas are commonly encountered and may require adaptation of principles used in treatment of congenital anomalies such as Hirschsprung's disease and Anorectal Malformations for reconstruction. Endemic conditions in certain LMIC require further research to delineate underlying causes and optimize management, such as "African" degenerative visceral leiomyopathy, congenital pouch colon in the Indian subcontinent, and congenital H-type rectal fistulae prevalent in Asia. These unique disease profiles require creative adaptations of resources within poor healthcare infrastructure settings. These special challenges and pitfalls in colorectal care and complications of adverse socioeconomic conditions, are discussed.
