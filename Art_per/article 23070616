Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Cardiometabolic diseases encompass simple monogenic enzyme deficiencies with well-established pathogenesis and clinical outcomes to complex polygenic diseases such as the cardiometabolic syndrome. The limited availability of relevant human cell types such as cardiomyocytes has hampered our ability to adequately model and study pathways or drugs relevant to these diseases in the heart. The recent discovery of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology now offers a powerful opportunity to establish translational platforms for cardiac disease modeling, drug discovery, and pre-clinical testing. In this article, we discuss the excitement and challenges of modeling cardiometabolic diseases using iPS cell and their potential to revolutionize translational research.
