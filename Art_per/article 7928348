Date : 1994
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This report deals with a 15-year-old girl suffering from the verrucous type of Thomson's syndrome. Initial poikilodermatous skin changes developed on both cheeks at the age of 3 months. Subsequently, rapid generalization of typical skin findings was observed. The clinical heterogenity of this syndrome is discussed with reference to the existing literature and the present case. Up to now, very few comparable cases of associated neurological symptoms have been described.
