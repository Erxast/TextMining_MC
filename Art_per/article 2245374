Abstract : Congenital malformations and inherited disorders constitute a substantial proportion of the afflictions seen in sheep and goats. Of these, malformations tend to be similar in both species, whereas the genetic diseases encountered to date, with the exception of a few, are different. Of the 28 genetic diseases of sheep and goats described in this review, 60% and 62.5%, respectively, are monogenic disorders. For a majority of the monogenic recessive disorders encountered in these species, the carrier state is not detectable at present, whereas in others, in which a biochemical lesion is known (dermatosparaxis, erythrocyte glutathione deficiency, globoid cell leukodystrophy and glycogen storage disease), the carrier state is detectable with the aid of enzyme and surface protein markers. The latter group and the dominant disorders (anury, cataract, glomerulonephritis, and lethal grey in sheep; gynecomastia and anotia-microtia complex in goats) are easy to eliminate through selective breeding. The polygenic disorders (entropion, epidermolysis bullosa, hereditary chondrodysplasia, and muscular dystrophy of sheep, and udder problems in goats) are more difficult to eradicate, because the mutant genes responsible for these traits generally do not declare themselves until inbreeding brings together a critical concentration to create a health crisis in some, whereas others, which are only short of a few of these mutant genes, might go totally unaffected and therefore undetected. Chromosome defects of the structural nature (translocations) seen in sheep and goats generally create meiotic disturbances, which in a majority of cases lead to subfertility, whereas sex chromosome aneuploids are generally sterile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
