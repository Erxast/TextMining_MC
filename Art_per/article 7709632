Abstract : We report a rare case of a female newborn presenting with muscular hypotonia, pneumonia, and cardiovascular and renal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed clinically and proven by extremely low cortisone (0.4-0.8 microgram/dl) and high ACTH plasma levels. Myopathy was diagnosed clinically, as well as by muscular biopsy. DNA analysis of both X chromosomes showed no abnormality in the region of the genes for adrenal hypoplasia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. After 4 weeks of intensive care therapy the patient died of multiorgan failure. At autopsy she had only microscopically visible fetal adrenal cells and multiple porencephalic lesions.
