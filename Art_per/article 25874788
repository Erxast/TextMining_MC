Abstract : Malignant hyperthermia is a genetic defect of uncontrolled hypermetabolic skeletal muscle response to anesthetic triggering drugs. Some congenital myopathies are regarded as risk increasing factors. The use of volatile anaesthetics or suxamethonium (succinylcholine) in patients who are predisposed to malignant hyperthermia leads to an increase in Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, which in turn causes a set of biochemical and clinical symptoms, which can be a cause of death, if dantrolene is not administered adequately. The aim of the study was to draw attention to the problem of malignant hyperthermia, which is hardly ever described in Polish literature, and requires the necessity of intensifying the cooperation between the dentist and specialists from other medical fields. The origin of the article was a case of congenital myopathy with recognized malignant hyperthermia in an 18-year-old patient, in whom surgical extraction of teeth was indicated. The course of diagnostics and treatment showed once more that contemporary medicine is in need of holistic approach, and in consequence, promising and effective cooperation of many specialists.
