Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy is a rare autosomal dominant degenerative neuromuscular and neuroendocrine disease. Pregnancy can aggravate the maternal disease. Obstetrical complications include stillbirth, premature labor, polyhydramnion, abnormal presentation, prolonged labor, increased operative delivery, postpartum hemorrhages and anesthetic accidents. If the fetus is affected severe neonatal morbidity and mortality with arthrogryposis and mental retardation is common. We present a case where the family chose continuation of pregnancy with a known diagnosis of maternal and severe fetal myotonic dystrophy. A multidisciplinary team was used in the management of pregnancy and counseling the patient.
