Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Reports on pregnancy and delivery issues in women with congenital myopathies are scarce. In this review, we summarize the medical literature along with updates of our own data. Included are patients with nemaline myopathy (n = 11), central core disease (n = 6), multi-minicore disease (n = 2), cytoplasmic body myopathy (n = 1), and congenital fiber-type disproportion (n = 1). Apart from 1 patient with nemaline myopathy, who had used a wheelchair from the age of 18years, all other women were able to walk when becoming pregnant. In comparison with the general population, there were no increased pregnancy or delivery complications, apart from the fact that 38% elective Cesarean sections took place. Neonatal outcome was favorable. In cases where a possible influence of gestation on muscle function was assessed, a deterioration during or after pregnancy was not observed. Patients who wish to have children should be advised by a multidisciplinary team according to the specific diagnosis, severity, and distribution of muscle weakness.
