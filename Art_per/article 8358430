Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy (DM) results from the amplification of an unstable CTG repeat in the 3' untranslated region of a transcript encoding a putative serine/threonine kinase. We have analysed the amplification of the repeat and the steady state levels of the DM kinase (DMK) mRNA in tissues and cell lines from normal and congenital DM individuals. Southern blot analysis of DNA samples from a severely affected neonate shows somatic heterogeneity of the repeat in all tissues studied. RNA analyses on these tissues show a marked increase in DMK steady state mRNA levels. We demonstrate that the mutant DMK allele is expressed regardless of the number of CTG repeats and that the increase in DMK mRNA levels is due to elevated mutant mRNA levels. We postulate that elevated DMK levels explains the dominant inheritance pattern of DM.
