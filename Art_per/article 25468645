Abstract : Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome (CDS) is caused by a defect in the CGI-58/ABHD5 gene resulting in a deficiency of CGI-58 and in intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerol in skin and liver. Patients are mainly characterized by congenital ichthyosis, but the clinical phenotype is very heterogeneous. Distinct brain involvement has never been described. We present a clinical description of two patients with congenital ichthyosis. On suspicion of Sj√∂gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) single-voxel 1H-MR spectroscopy of the brain was performed and biochemical testing of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) to establish this diagnosis gave normal results. Vacuolisation in a peripheral blood smear has led to the CDS suspicion. In both patients the diagnosis CDS was confirmed by ABHD5 mutation analysis. Interestingly, a clear lipid accumulation in the cerebral white matter, cortex and basal ganglia was demonstrated in both CDS-patients. These results demonstrate, for the first time, cerebral involvement in CDS and give new insights in the complex phenotype. Since the clinical implications of this abnormal cerebral lipid accumulation are still unknown, further studies are warranted.
