Abstract : Typical central core disease (CCD) is characterized pathologically by the presence of a core and is accompanied by type 1 fiber uniformity. Congenital neuromuscular disease with uniform type 1 fiber (CNMDU1) is characterized pathologically by the presence of type 1 fiber uniformity but without the abnormal structural changes in muscle fibers. Interestingly, typical CCD and 40% of CNMDU1 cases are caused by the same mutations in RYR1, and thus CNMDU1 has been considered an early precursor to CCD. To better understand the nature of CNMDU1, we re-evaluated muscle biopsies from 16 patients with CNMDU1 using immunohistochemistry to RYR1, triadin and TOM20, and compared this to muscle biopsies from 36 typical CCD patients. In CCD, RYR1, and triadin were present in the core regions, while TOM20 was absent in the core regions. Interestingly, in 5 CNMDU1 cases with the RYR1 mutation, RYR1, and triadin were similarly present in core-like areas, while TOM20 was absent in the subsarcolemmal region. Furthermore, there was a correlation between the core position and the disease duration or progression-the older patients in more advanced stages had more centralized cores. Our results indicate that CNMDU1 due to RYR1 mutation is a de facto core myopathy.
