Abstract : With few exceptions, epidermolysis bullosa (EB) simplex is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by rather localized and recurrent nonscarring blister formation; mucous membranes and other organs are usually uninvolved. Recently, two patients were described with an autosomal recessive form of EB simplex associated with muscular dystrophy. We now describe four additional patients with autosomal recessive EB simplex, three of whom had associated muscular dystrophy or congenital myasthenia gravis. These patients had generalized cutaneous findings, including milia, atrophic scarring, nail dystrophy, and scalp alopecia, which have been classically attributed to either junctional or dystrophic EB. Each patient had significant oral cavity involvement, and in two, marked growth retardation and anemia were also present. Our findings suggest that autosomal recessive EB simplex may be characterized by rather severe cutaneous and extracutaneous disease activity, and may be associated with at least two distinct neuromuscular diseases.
