Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : An infant presented with congenital hypotonia, poor sucking, apathy, and areflexia. Muscle biopsy at two months of age revealed numerous nemaline rods, suggesting congenital nemaline myopathy. During the ensuing months, familial dysautonomia was suggested by recurrent pulmonary infections, dysphagia, alacrima, hyperhydrosis, emotional lability, and unexplained episodes of hyperthermia and breath-holding spells. The diagnosis was confirmed by positive intradermal histamine and ocular mecholyl tests. The finding of nemaline rods adds a new facet to the recognized polymorphic presentation of familial dysautonomia.
