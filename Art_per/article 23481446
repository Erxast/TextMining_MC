Abstract : Seven children (5Â male, 2 female) were seen over the last 16 years with rigid spine syndrome. Six children had rigid spinal muscular dystrophy (selenoprotein N1-related myopathy [SEPN1RM]) and 1 had myopathy associated with rigid spine. The main presenting complaint in all was difficulty in bending the spine. The diagnosis was made on clinical features and imaging of the paraspinal muscles. Muscle histopathology revealed minimal myopathic changes to severe muscle degeneration. Genetic testing, which was only available for the last case, for selenoprotein was negative.
