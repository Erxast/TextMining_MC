Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Recent clinical and experimental studies suggest that zinc deficiency may play an important role in the pathogenesis of (1) acrodermatitis enteropathica, and in certain cases of (2) hypogonadal dwarfism, (3) congenital malformations, (4) hypogeusia and hyposmia, (5) nyctalopia and (6) impaired wound healing. Distrubances of zinc metabolism also occur in a broad spectrum of other clinical disorders. The pathophysiological factors which are responsible for hypozincemia include: (1) nutritional deficiency and/or intestinal malabsorption of zinc; (2) hyperzincuria secondary to aminoaciduria; (3) hormonal effects (cortisol, growth hormone, estrogens); (4) hypoalbuminemia; and (5) effects of leukocytic endogenous mediator. The clinical diagnosis of zinc deficiency in patients with specific neurological, dermatological and musculoskeletal disorders is complicated by the complex interactions of these pathophysiological factors and by the need for more dependable laboratory indices of zinc deprivation.
