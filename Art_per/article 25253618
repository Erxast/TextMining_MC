Title : Perosomus elumbis in Danish Holstein cattle.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Perosomus elumbis (PE) is a congenital defect that has been observed sporadically in Holstein cattle for many years. However, several cases have been reported in recent years and this may indicate an unrecognised spread of a mutant allele in the Holstein population worldwide. Two cases in Danish Holstein calves are reported to provide details on the phenotype.Two full-term Holstein calves were born after assisted delivery due to dystocia with breech presentation. External morphological examination indicated that the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal vertebrae were absent and the abdominal region was just present as a floppy sac covered by skin and enclosing the abdominal organs. The hind limbs were hypoplastic with bilateral symmetric arthrogryposis and muscular atrophy. Radiographs, computed tomography scan and necropsy confirmed these findings. The caudal part of the thoracic spinal cord showed myelodysplasia. A range of abdominal organ malformations were found at necropsy. Inbreeding was not found during genealogical examination, but remote shared ancestors were present in the pedigrees.The addition of these further cases of PE to the in recent years reported record of cases should draw more attention to this defect in the Holstein breed. PE may be an emerging genetic defect in the Holstein population worldwide and cases should be sampled to enable genetic mapping of the gene possibly underlying the disease. PE cases seem to be associated with a high risk of dystocia due to increased rate of breech presentation.
