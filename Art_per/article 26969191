Abstract : Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is an important Ca(2+) influx pathway in somatic cells. In addition to maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores, Ca(2+) entry through store-operated channels regulates essential signaling pathways in numerous cell types. Patients with mutations in the store-operated channel subunit ORAI1 exhibit defects in store-operated Ca(2+) influx, along with severe immunodeficiency, congenital myopathy and ectodermal dysplasia. However, little is known about the functional role of ORAI1 in germ cells and reproductive function in mice, or in men, since men with loss-of-function or null mutations in ORAI1 rarely survive to reproductive age. In this study, we investigated the role of ORAI1 in male reproductive function. We reveal that Orai1(-/-) male mice are sterile and have severe defects in spermatogenesis, with prominent deficiencies in mid- to late-stage elongating spermatid development. These studies establish an essential in vivo role for store-operated ORAI1 channels in male reproductive function and identify these channels as potential non-steroidal regulators of male fertility.
