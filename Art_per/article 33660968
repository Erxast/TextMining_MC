Abstract : Volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries are characterized by a degree of tissue loss that exceeds the endogenous regenerative capacity of muscle, resulting in permanent structural and functional deficits. Such injuries are a consequence of trauma, as well as a host of congenital and acquired diseases and disorders. Despite significant preclinical research with diverse biomaterials, as well as early clinical studies with implantation of decellularized extracellular matrices, there are still significant barriers to more complete restoration of muscle form and function following repair of VML injuries. In fact, identification of novel biomaterials with more advantageous regenerative profiles is a critical limitation to the development of improved therapeutics. As a first step in this direction, we evaluated a novel semisynthetic hyaluronic acid-based (HyA) hydrogel that embodies material features more favorable for robust muscle regeneration. This HyA-based hydrogel is composed of an acrylate-modified HyA (AcHyA) macromer, an AcHyA macromer conjugated with the bsp-RGD(15) peptide sequence to enhance cell adhesion, a high-molecular-weight heparin to sequester growth factors, and a matrix metalloproteinase-cleavable cross-linker to allow for cell-dependent remodeling. In a well-established, clinically relevant rat tibialis anterior VML injury model, we report observations of robust functional recovery, accompanied by volume reconstitution, muscle regeneration, and native-like vascularization following implantation of the HyA-based hydrogel at the site of injury. These findings have important implications for the development and clinical application of the improved biomaterials that will be required for stable and complete functional recovery from diverse VML injuries.
