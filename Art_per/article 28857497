Abstract : Despite ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are the most common congenital heart diseases (CHDs) in the neonatal period, their incidence and natural history are still debated and their follow-up and management strategies remain controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the incidence and natural history of isolated VSDs.From January 1996 to December 2015 all neonates with a CHD suspicion were referred to the Cardiological Department of Grosseto Misericordia Hospital. Only newborns with confirmed isolated VSD were enrolled in this study and followed for 6 years.Our 343 newborns with an isolated VSD (incidence of 10.45/1000/births) account for 64% of all detected CHDs. VSDs location were as follows: muscular (73.8%), perimembranous (11.3%), inlet (1%), and outlet (0.8%). Of the located VSDs, 90% were small, 7.5% moderate, and 2.5% large, respectively. Spontaneous closure was observed in 96 (29.2%) of the VSD patients at 6-month, 198 (60.2%) at 1-year, 261 (79.3%) at 2-year, and in 302 (91.8%) at 6-year follow-up. Risk factors for defect persistence were a perimembranous location (P = .001; HR: 0.508, CI: 0.342-0.755), detection of multiple defects (P = .043; HR: 0.728, CI: 0.536-0.990), and male gender (P < .048; HR: 0.783, CI: 0.615-0.998), respectively.We here provide an incidence and natural history of neonatal isolated VSDs in a neonatal Caucasian population. These data may be useful for the development of expert consensus/standard recommendation guidelines for the follow-up and VSD management, data that are currently lacking.
