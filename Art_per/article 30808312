Abstract : Collagen VI-related myopathies are a spectrum of muscular diseases with features of muscle weakness and atrophy, multiple contractures of joints, distal hyperextensibility, severe respiratory dysfunction and cutaneous alterations, attributable to mutations in the COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes. However, no case of collagen VI mutations with hematuria has been reported. We report a 14-year-old boy who had both Bethlem myopathy and recurrent hematuria and who carried a known de novo COL6A1 missense mutation c.877G > A (p.G293R).The patient was a 14-year-old boy presenting with muscle weakness from 3 years of age without any family history. Six months before admission, he developed recurrent gross hematuria, three bouts in total, with the presence of blood clots in the urine. Next-generation sequencing of his whole-exome was performed. The result of sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous G-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 877 in exon 10 of the COL6A1 gene. After treatment, the hematuria healed, but the muscle weakness failed to improve.Hematuria in Bethlem myopathy can be caused by COL6 mutations, which may be related to the aberrant connection between collagen VI and collagen IV.
