Abstract : Myosin storage myopathy (OMIM 608358), a congenital myopathy characterised by subsarcolemmal, hyaline-like accumulations of myosin in Type I muscle fibres, was first described by Cancilla and Colleagues in 1971 [Neurology 1971;21:579-585] in two siblings as 'familial myopathy with probable lysis of myofibrils in type I muscle fibres'. Two mutations in the slow skeletal myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) have recently been associated with the disease in other families. We have identified a novel heterozygous Leu1793Pro mutation in MYH7 in DNA from paraffin sections of one of the original siblings. This historical molecular analysis confirms the original cases had myosin storage myopathy.
