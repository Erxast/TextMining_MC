Abstract : Myositis ossificans progressiva is a rare connective tissue disorder. We present here a case of myositis ossificans progressiva with some unusual presentations and associated congenital skeletal anomalies that are reported very infrequently in the literature. The case report highlights the importance of early diagnosis in a case of rapidly progressive myositis ossificans progressiva.
