Abstract : Despite judicious monitoring and care, patients with fatty acid oxidation disorders may experience metabolic decompensation due to infection which may result in rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction and failure. Since clinical studies on metabolic decompensation are dangerous, we employed a preclinical model of metabolic decompensation due to infection. By infecting mice with mouse adapted influenza and using a pair-feeding strategy in a mouse model of long-chain fatty acid oxidation (Acadvl<sup>-/-</sup>), our goals were to isolate the effects of infection on tissue acylcarnitines and determine how they relate to their plasma counterparts. Applying statistical data reduction techniques (Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis), we were able to identify critical acylcarnitines that were driving differentiation of our experimental groups for all the tissues studied. While plasma displayed increases in metabolites directly related to mouse VLCAD deficiency (e.g. C16 and C18), organs like the heart, muscle and liver also showed involvement of alternative pathways (e.g. medium-chain FAO and ketogenesis), suggesting adaptive measures. Matched correlation analyses showed strong correlations (r > 0.7) between plasma and tissue levels for a small number of metabolites. Overall, our results demonstrate that infection as a stress produces perturbations in metabolism in Acadvl<sup>-/-</sup> that differ greatly from WT infected and Acadvl<sup>-/-</sup> pair-fed controls. This model system will be useful for studying the effects of infection on tissue metabolism as well as evaluating interventions aimed at modulating the effects of metabolic decompensation.
