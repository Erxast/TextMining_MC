Abstract : To determine the incidence and neonatal morbidity and mortality of congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM) in Canada.The study has 2 phases. A 5-year prospective monthly surveillance of incident cases of CDM conducted via the Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program, from March 1, 2005-February 28, 2010, and a 5-year cohort study of eligible incident cases, which is ongoing and not the subject of this report.A total of 121 cases were reported, with 38 confirmed as CDM. The incidence of CDM in Canada is 2.1/100,000 (1/47,619) live births. The cases were reported from 8 provinces and 1 territory. The highest reported incidence was Ontario with 15, followed by British Columbia with 7, and Quebec with 6. External validation of cases was performed. The trinucleotide repeat level varied from 550-3100. Twenty-two (58%) of the children were the index cases for their families. Seventeen children are currently enrolled in the ongoing cohort study.Surveillance and prospective examination of CDM at a population level is important, as the impact of this rare disease is systemic, chronic, and associated with significant morbidity and mortality throughout childhood.
