Title : Split posterior tibial-tendon transfer in spastic cerebral palsy.
Date : 1983
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Sixteen split posterior tibial-tendon transfers, usually with heel-cord lengthening, were performed on sixteen children with spastic cerebral palsy and equinovarus deformities. The patients were followed for a minimum of two years postoperatively. All of the varus deformities were corrected, although two patients required an osteotomy of the calcaneus because of fixed varus deformity. There were no recurrences of the varus deformities, nor were any valgus or calcaneal deformities produced, and the equinus element of the gait was eliminated.
