Date : 1989
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A 19-year-old man born with thyroprivic hypothyroidism, due to congenital development defect, manifested hypogonadism, stunted growth, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), diffuse muscle weakness and wasting, right bundle branch block, cerebral atrophy. Muscle biopsy showed mitochondrial abnormalities. Biochemical investigations on muscle disclosed partial (50%) cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, 58% decrease of cytochrome aa3 and 41% decrease of cytochrome b. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed decrease of the immunologically active enzyme protein.
