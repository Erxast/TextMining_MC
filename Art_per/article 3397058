Abstract : Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and 12 Xp21-derived DNA probes, we have constructed a continuous restriction map spanning more than 4 million base pairs (4 Mbp), including the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene of more than 2 Mbp. This detailed map is part of a less detailed map spanning 10 Mbp, also spanning the genes for glycerol kinase and congenital adrenal hypoplasia, constructed under electrophoresis conditions which separated DNA fragments in the range 200 to 4000 kbp. DNA from three different tissues was analyzed, and differential methylation was observed.
