Abstract : An 18-year-old high-school boy presented facial muscle weakness since birth, and then developed wasting around the neck, shoulder girdle, upper arms, and thighs. He was born to un-consanguineous parents. His father had suffered from similar but milder muscle atrophy with predominance on the right side of the face and shoulder girdle since adolescence. His mother and his only sibling were clinically unaffected. Hearing disturbance was detected at the age of 6, and he also noted atrophy of the tongue and the bilateral thighs at the age of 10. The symptom progressed gradually. Neurological examination on admission revealed a well-developed boy (166 cm/60 kg) with a prominent facial diplegia with distinct proximal muscular atrophy of the extremities. Muscles of the tongue, neck, upper arms, shoulder and pelvic girdles, and hamstrings were markedly involved. The anterior tibial muscles were also affected, while the calf muscles were hypertrophic. High arched palate, X legs, mild lordoscoliosis were also noted. Serum CK was slightly increased (424 IU/l), and needle EMG in the extremities including the tongue revealed myopathic changes. Muscle CT demonstrated marked atrophy of the proximal muscles in the lower limbs and hypertrophy of the calf muscles. Audiogram showed bilateral sensorineural hearing disturbance. Muscle biopsy of the gastrocnemius showed myogenic as well as neurogenic changes consisting of atrophic and hypertrophic fibers with interstitial cellular infiltration, and type I fiber predominance. With these family history as well as clinical and laboratory examinations, this case could be diagnosed as "congenital facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
