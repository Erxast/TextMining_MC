Abstract : Centro-nuclear myopathy is a congenital myopathy characterized by the presence of central nuclei on muscle biopsy. Three clinical forms have been distinguished. Classification depends on the type inherited, age of onset and degree of muscle involvement.We describe the case of a female patient in whom the diagnosis of centro-nuclear myopathy was made at the age of 53. The patient had not been studied previously, but was sent to us by the Department of Anaesthesia. The clinical features had first appeared in infancy. There was no family history of this disorder. Apparently this was a sporadic case.In the differential diagnosis of adult patients with girdle paresthesias centro-nuclear myopathy should be included. This unusual muscle disorder may be need to be considered if anaesthesia is required.
