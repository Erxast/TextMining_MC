Abstract : Foot deformities are common in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. In this group of 52 patients with this diagnosis, 43 had foot deformities. The involvement was bilateral in all cases, and the most common type of deformity was talipes equinovarus (72 feet). The primary treatment in 52 of these patients was operative. Brockmann's procedure was the preferred method during the earlier years and posteromedial or posteromedioplantar release since 1974. Recurrences of the deformity are common; 36 operative procedures were done in 15 feet for recurrence of talipes equinovarus. The primary operative treatment should be extensive enough to correct all components of the deformity. Knee and hip deformity will often influence the outcome. Knee deformities especially cause problems in retaining the desired position of the feet. Talectomy and bone decancellations both seem to be effective in treating recurrences.
