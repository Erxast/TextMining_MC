Abstract : Choline kinase beta gene (CHKB) mutations have been identified in Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDCMC) patients, but never in patients with an additional combined deficiency of complexes I, III and IV and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion.To report mutations in carry genes for MDCMC with respiratory chain defects and mtDNA depletion.Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify the carry genes in a Spanish child with muscle weakness, mild hypotonia at lower limb muscles, mildly elevated creatine kinase (CK), enlarged mitochondria in the periphery of the fibers, combined deficiency of complex I, III and IV and depletion of mtDNA.With WES data, it was possible to get the whole mtDNA sequencing and discard any pathogenic variant in this genome. The first filter of WES data with the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (MitoCarta) did not get any candidate. However, the analysis of whole exome uncovered a homozygous nonsense pathogenic mutation in CHKB gene (NM_005198.4:c.810T>A, p.Tyr270*).Our data confirm the role of CHKB in MDCMC and point to this gene as unique candidate for the combined deficiency of respiratory chain and mtDNA depletion observed in this patient.
