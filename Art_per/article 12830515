Abstract : Based on the literature and their own observations of 44 children aged 5-15 years (27 girls, 17 boys) with prior strokes, the authors characterize the types of strokes and principle causes of the disease as follows: (1) intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhages (key etiology--arteriovenous malformations, blood disorders, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenias, thrombocytopathy, etc.) and (2) ischemic strokes i.e. (i) thrombotic (congenital and acquired vascular aplasias, angiitis, antiphospholipoid and viral vasculopathy, blood system coagulate activation, etc.); (ii) embolic (cardiogenic, septic, placental, etc.) and (iii) hemodynamic as a consequence of severe cardiomyopathy and disrupted total hemodynamics. The definitions of metabolic stroke as a complication of mitochondrial encephalopathy, homocystinuria and non-differentiated stroke caused more often by emergence of pathologic weariness of connective tissues were suggested. To elicit the stroke causes and types in children, the authors propose a reliable algorithm for clinico-instrumental diagnostic screening in acute period of stroke.
