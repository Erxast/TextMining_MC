Date : 2003
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The management of children and adults with upper motor neuron disorder is complex and multifaceted. This article reviews new information and potential treatment. As part of the upper motor neuron syndrome (UMNS), spasticity may occur in cerebral palsy, congenital brain malformation, head injury, or other etiologies. Within the UMNS the most recognizable clinical concern is the frequent abnormality of tone, which may have a significant functional impact. Tone reduction is not itself a goal, but is performed for the functional benefits it may allow. New approaches to treatment and management of hypertonia recently have become available. There are many other associated features of the UMNS that affect patient functioning. Ones that frequently occur are abnormalities of speech and other areas of oral motor control. A new area of intervention combines the use of botulinum toxin and ultrasonography to address the common problem of slalorrhea, which is a potential medical issue and a substantial social barrier in affected patients. This article also reviews new information and potential treatment for neuromuscular disorders.
