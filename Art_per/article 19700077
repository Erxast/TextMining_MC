Title : Congenital hand differences.
Date : 2009
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This article explores recent developments for 6 common congenital hand differences, including polydactyly, syndactyly, camptodactyly, clinodactyly, trigger thumb, and cleft hand. These differences are challenging because the surgeon must understand the potential for both functional and social (ie, appearance) issues in order to provide ideal treatment for each child and family. Therapy or surgical correction plays a role for most of these children. Recent investigations have provided additional data on the expected outcomes following intervention.
