Abstract : Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) is a rare nonlysosomal neutral lipid storage disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosis, lipid vacuoles in leukocytes (Jordan's anomaly), and hepatomegaly. The authors herein report an 18-month-old boy with ichthyosis and hepatomegaly diagnosed with CDS and confirmed to have a novel c.506-3C>G mutation in the ABHD5/CGI-58 gene. Our case also illustrates that retinoids such as acitretin could be useful in the treatment of skin manifestations in CDS even in the presence of liver derangement.
