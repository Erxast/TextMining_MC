Abstract : We report the case of a 31-year-old woman with no history of heart disease. She came to the hospital with fever, dyspnea, palpitation, and edema of the lower extremities. She was found to have aortic, mitral, and pulmonary valve insufficiency, and the initial diagnosis was subacute bacterial endocarditis. At surgery, we replaced the aortic and mitral valves with mechanical prostheses and the pulmonary valve with a bioprosthesis. The prostheses were soaked intraoperatively with fluconazole and the heart chambers were irrigated with povidone-iodine to prevent infection by bacteria and fungi. We also found 2 previously unsuspected anomalies: 1 was a muscular bundle that divided the right ventricle into 2 chambers, and the other was a ventricular septal defect, 1.0 cm in diameter. We resected the muscular bundle and patched the septal defect. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was in New York Heart Association functional class I at the 15-month follow-up visit. We speculate that this patient's congenital anomalies made the heart more susceptible to damage from the endocarditis. Therefore, any patient who has infective endocarditis should also be examined closely for congenital defects.
