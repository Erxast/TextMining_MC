Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In 13 German Holstein calves from two different dairy farms arthrogryposis of the front legs, facial scoliosis and torticollis were observed. Obvious environmental reasons could not be found. Chromosomal anomalies in two affected calves were not detectable. A striking feature was the high frequency of affected calves among the offspring of one natural service sire. A plausible explanation of the congenital anomalies observed is a dominantly inherited mutation restricted to germ cells.
