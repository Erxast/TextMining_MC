Date : 2016
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We use issues that arose in the management of a 4-year old girl with a congenital myopathy to consider the tension between respecting the choices and decisions of the child's parents and applying clinical practice guidelines that emphasise minimising risk to the child. This case raises the issue of when it is reasonable to override parents' choice of management options.
