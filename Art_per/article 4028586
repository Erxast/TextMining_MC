Title : A cerebral cause of arthrogryposis: unilateral cerebral hypoplasia.
Date : 1985
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The authors describe a case of predominantly right-sided arthrogryposis in an infant with contralateral congenital cerebral hypoplasia and associated unilateral hydrocephalus. Diagnosis was made by prenatal ultrasonography and confirmed by postnatal cerebral CT-scanning. In addition to a variety of congenital neuromuscular disorders, arthrogryposis may be caused by disorders of the central nervous system. Hence, in the diagnostic approach of newborns with congenital contractures, cerebral malformations must be considered.
