Title : Clinical approach to the diagnosis of congenital myopathies.
Date : 2011
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In this issue of Seminars in Pediatric Neurology, each chapter will focus on the features and management of individual congenital myopathies. This introductory chapter will provide an overview of the clinical features that alert the clinician to the likely diagnosis of a congenital myopathy, and specific features on history and examination that are characteristic of a specific genetic subtype. Most congenital myopathies share a common pattern of clinical features, which makes it difficult to predict the genetic cause in a patient by clinical assessment alone. Although no single feature is specific for the congenital myopathies, the presence of this common pattern highlights patients in whom a muscle biopsy is likely to provide important diagnostic information. The diagnosis of a specific congenital myopathy should only be made when the defining morphologic feature is the predominant pathologic change, other possible causes have been excluded, and the clinical course is nonprogressive or only slowly progressive.
