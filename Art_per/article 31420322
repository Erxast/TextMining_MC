Abstract : Structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain-containing 1 (SMCHD1) is an architectural factor critical for X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and the repression of select autosomal gene clusters. In mice, homozygous nonsense mutations in <i>Smchd1</i> cause female-specific embryonic lethality due to an XCI defect. However, although human mutations in <i>SMCHD1</i> are associated with congenital arhinia and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2), the diseases do not show a sex-specific bias, despite the essential nature of XCI in humans. To investigate whether there is a dosage imbalance for the sex chromosomes, we here analyze transcriptomic data from arhinia and FSHD2 patient blood and muscle cells. We find that <i>X</i>-linked dosage compensation is maintained in these patients. In mice, SMCHD1 controls not only protocadherin (<i>Pcdh</i>) gene clusters, but also <i>Hox</i> genes critical for craniofacial development. Ablating <i>Smchd1</i> results in aberrant expression of these genes, coinciding with altered chromatin states and three-dimensional (3D) topological organization. In a subset of FSHD2 and arhinia patients, we also found dysregulation of clustered <i>PCDH</i>, but not <i>HOX</i> genes. Overall, our study demonstrates preservation of XCI in arhinia and FSHD2, and implicates SMCHD1 in the regulation of the 3D organization of select autosomal gene clusters.
