Abstract : We describe a case of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactacidosis, and stroke-like episode (MELAS syndrome) associated with ventricular septal defect and meningocele at the L3 level in a 5-year-old girl. Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed point mutation at nucleotide 3271--> TC. The occurrence of heart and neural tube defects in association with usual features of the MELAS syndrome might be explained by either defective high-energy metabolism during early embryogenesis or a common genetic cause.
