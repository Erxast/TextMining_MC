Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report on the prenatal diagnosis of bilateral fetal cataract in the 17th week of pregnancy as the first ultrasonographic sign of a Walker-Warburg syndrome in a familial case. No other anomalies could be detected by ultrasonographic examination at that time. Both the bilateral fetal cataract and specific abnormalities of a Walker-Warburg syndrome were confirmed after the termination of the pregnancy in the second trimester.
