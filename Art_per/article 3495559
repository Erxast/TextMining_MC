Title : Potassium disturbances as a cause of metabolic neuromyopathy.
Date : 1987
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report two cases of ascending muscular weakness progressing to areflexic quadriplegia caused by severe derangement of potassium homeostasis. The first patient presented with a 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency and severe hypokalemia. The second case had primary adrenocortical deficiency (Addison's disease) and extreme hyperkalemia. Complete recovery ensued after correction of the metabolic disorder in both cases. The role of potassium in the pathophysiology of neuromuscular excitation is discussed. We conclude that when neuromyopathy is present, metabolic causes should be considered and the serum potassium determined.
