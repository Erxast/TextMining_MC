Title : The management of trigger thumb in children.
Date : 1991
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Trigger thumb in children is an uncommon condition. We reviewed 41 patients with 53 trigger thumbs. Although the current accepted approach to the treatment of congenital trigger thumbs is a prolonged period of observation, our findings indicate that all of our patients eventually required surgical release of the flexor pollicis longus tendon. Waiting 3 years before a surgical release was done did not affect the surgical result.
