Abstract : Glatiramer acetate (GA), an agent modulating the immune system, has been shown to cause significantly improved mobility and hind limb muscle strength in the dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mouse model for LAMA2-congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD). In view of these findings and the prominent peripheral nervous system involvement in this laminin-α2 disorder we evaluated GA's effect on dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> motor nerve conduction electrophysiologically.Left sciatic-tibial motor nerve conduction studies were performed on wild type (WT) mice (n = 10), control dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mice (n = 11), and GA treated dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mice (n = 10) at 18 weeks of age.Control dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mice average velocities (34.49 ± 2.15 m/s) were significantly slower than WT (62.57 ± 2.23 m/s; p < 0.0005), confirming the clinical observation of hindlimb paresis in dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mice attributed to peripheral neuropathy. GA treated dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mice showed significantly improved average sciatic-tibial motor nerve conduction velocity versus control dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> (50.35 ± 2.9 m/s; p < 0.0005).In this study we show for the first time improvement in motor nerve conduction velocity of LAMA2-CMD dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mouse model's hereditary peripheral neuropathy following GA treatment.This study suggests a possible therapeutic effect of glatiramer acetate on hereditary peripheral neuropathy in this laminin-α2 disorder.
