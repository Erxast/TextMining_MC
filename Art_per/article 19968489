Abstract : Multiple congenital contractures, also known as fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) and related terms, result from decreased fetal movement. The underlying etiologies are diverse and include central nervous system (CNS) dysgeneses and primary myopathies. Persistent central nuclei or the presence of myotubes is often regarded as evidence of a primary myopathic etiology; however, these findings are also associated with impaired fetal innervation. We report 7 fetuses, estimated gestational age 20 to 23 weeks, with persistent myotubular morphology, a change that could be (mis)interpreted as a primary myopathy. In 4 of the patients, CNS histology showed hypoxic/ischemic injury, polymicrogyria, mineralized neurons, and microinfarcts with or without loss of anterior horn neurons. FADS cases with polymicrogyria have frequently been interpreted as a consequence of a primary brain malformation. Only a few descriptions of FADS associate polymicrogyria with CNS hypoxic/ischemic injury, however, and do not describe skeletal muscle maturation delay. We hypothesize that this combination of neural and muscular pathology is an under-recognized pattern in FADS, which results from diffuse hypoxic/ischemic injury involving the brain and spinal cord during early to middle gestation.
