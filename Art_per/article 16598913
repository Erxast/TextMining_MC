Title : External fixation for the foot and ankle in children.
Date : 2006
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : During the last decade, external fixation for the pediatric foot and ankle has evolved as a result of advances in technology (eg, Taylor spatial frame, hydroxyapatite-coated external fixator pins) and preoperative deformity planning. Although complications are common, most are minor and can be addressed nonoperatively while treatment continues. This article reviews the indications and applications of external fixation for soft tissue contractures, idiopathic and teratologic clubfoot, osteotomies, metatarsal lengthening, tibial lengthening, and foot and ankle trauma.
