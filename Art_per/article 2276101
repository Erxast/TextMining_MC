Title : Hemifacial spasm and craniovertebral anomaly.
Date : 1990
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Two patients with congenital anomaly of the craniovertebral junction causing disabling hemifacial spasm (HFS) are presented. In one patient, complete cessation of the HFS occurred for a period of two years following simple bony decompression of the craniovertebral junction raising unanswered questions as to the exact pathogenesis of HFS. Eventually both patients required microvascular decompression at the root entry zone of the facial nerve.
