Title : Paraplegia and congenital contractures as a consequence of intrauterine trauma.
Date : 1992
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We present a newborn infant with paraplegia and contractures of the lower limbs, consistent with neurologic injury rather than malformation. The mother was involved in a severe motor vehicle accident during the sixth month of pregnancy. We propose that this infant's injuries are a result of that accident.
