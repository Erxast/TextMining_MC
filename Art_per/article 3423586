Abstract : A 34 year-old man had complained since childhood of weakness of the right lower limb. His mother had a myopathy. Examination showed weakness and amyotrophy of the antero-external regions of the legs, mainly on the left, moderate weakness of the right scapular girdle and slight facial weakness. Serum creatine kinase was increased. Electromyogram and CT scan images were of the myogenic type. Biopsy showed a centronuclear myopathy. The course was slowly progressive. Centronuclear myopathy is rare in adults. The facio-scapulo-humeral localization has been described in numerous other pathologic types of myopathy.
