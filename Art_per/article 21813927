Abstract : Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder characterised by extreme pleiotropism and variability in disease expression. A congenital form is rare and is observed in infants born to symptomatic mothers with multisystem involvement. We report a case of a neonate with congenital myotonic dystrophy born to an asymptomatic mother.
