Abstract : Equinus deformity is a common finding in children with cerebral palsy and may be treated by Achilles tendon lengthening. To prevent recurrence, some authors recommend immobilizing the operated leg with an above-knee cast for six weeks, followed by use of a night splint or orthosis. Nevertheless, there are recurrence rates of up to 20.5%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term result of postoperative immobilization for two weeks in a below-knee cast and early weight bearing, without the use of a splint or orthosis. Thirty-six children (52 feet) with spastic cerebral palsy underwent sliding Achilles tendon lengthening. Follow-up of five to ten years showed a comparable recurrence rate (19.2%) to that reported with the standard, more stringent management approach. Most of the recurrences were in children operated on before five years of age. We believe earlier motion helps to sustain the tendon length achieved at surgery and allows for earlier independent gait.
