Abstract : Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is not rare and has a high mortality in the paediatric intensive care unit. However, there are few reports about this in the emergency department (ED). We report an 8â€‰month-old male patient with ACS in shock associated with gastric volvulus who improved rapidly by a simple procedure in the ED. He had congenital comorbidities, including multiple cranial anomalies and was transferred because of decreased mental status. He had compensated shock with cold and mottled skin of the lower extremities, paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale of E3V5M6 and prominence of the left upper abdomen. The abdominal X-ray showed a considerably distended stomach. Soon after aspiration of gastric contents, shock and mental status improved. Physicians should consider ACS in the differential diagnosis of shock with abdominal distention. ACS may be ameliorated by gastric suction. Gastric volvulus can induce shock and decreased mental status, particularly in patients with comorbidities.
