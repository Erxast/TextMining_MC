Abstract : We hypothesised that disorders with anterior temporal lobe (ATL) cysts might exhibit common peculiarities and distinguishable imaging features that could be useful for diagnosis. We reviewed a series of patients for neuroimaging contributions to specific diagnoses.A literature search was conducted, and institutional imaging files were reviewed to identify MR examinations with ATL cysts in children. Patients were divided according to head size, calcifications, white matter and cortical abnormalities. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of patients on the basis of their MR and CT items was performed.We identified 23 patients in our database in whom MR revealed ATL cysts. Our series included five patients with congenital muscular dystrophy (05/23=21.7 %), six with megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (06/23=26.1 %), three with non-megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (03/23=13.1 %), seven with congenital cytomegalovirus disease (07/23=30.4 %) and two with Aicardi-Gouti√®res syndrome (02/23=8.7 %). After analysis, 11 clusters resulted in the highest discriminative indices. Thereafter, patients' clusters were linked to their underlying diseases. The features that best discriminated between clusters included brainstem abnormalities, cerebral calcifications and some peculiar grey and white matter abnormalities. A flow chart was drafted to guide the radiologist in these diagnoses.The authors encourage the combined interpretation of these features in the herein proposed approach that confidently predicted the final diagnosis in this particular group of disorders associated with ATL cysts.
