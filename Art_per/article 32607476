Abstract : Myopathies caused by <i>MYH7</i> gene mutations are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous and, until recently, difficult to diagnose. The availability of NGS panels for hereditary neuromuscular diseases changed our insight regarding their frequency and allowed a better perception of the different phenotypes and morphological abnormalities associated. We present a male Portuguese patient with the classical phenotype of Laing early-onset distal myopathy (MPD1) beginning at 6 years of age, very slowly progressive, and with a mild to moderate impact on daily life by the age of 56. Muscle biopsy showed a myopathic pattern with hyaline bodies and cores. The NGS panel for structural myopathies identified a novel missense heterozygous variant, c.T4652C (p.Leu1551Pro), in the exon 34 of the <i>MYH7</i> gene.
