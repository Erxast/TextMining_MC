Abstract : A comparative study has been done of the static B-scan ultrasound appearance of the quadriceps muscle of the thigh in 60 new patients attending our muscle clinic and in 60 control children. In the control subjects there was good visualization of bone and fascia, which stood out clearly against the background of echo-free muscle tissue. Striking change was found in children with neuromuscular disease. Muscular dystrophies were associated with an increase in the intensity of echo reflected from the muscle substance, with corresponding loss of bone echo. Spinal muscular atrophies and neuropathies also showed an increase in muscle echo along with atrophy of the muscle and increase in depth of subcutaneous tissue. Various congenital myopathies also showed changes. Infants with hypotonia from nonneuromuscular causes had normal scans. Severity of change on the scan did not relate to functional disability, and some children had good function yet strikingly abnormal scans. Three degree of change on the scan correlated with the degree of disruption of muscle architecture on biopsy. Ultrasound imaging has proved to be a useful, noninvasive screening tool in the investigation of children with neuromuscular disease.
