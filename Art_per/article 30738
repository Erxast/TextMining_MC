Date : 1978
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A case of a newborn infant with clinical and angiocardiographic signs of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is presented. The baby died after a short therapy with beta-blockers. Light- and electron-microscopic investigations showed severe disorganization of muscular cellular arrangement and disturbances of intracellular structures of the interventricular septum. HOCM is a genetically determined disease which can present clinically in the newborn period and may simulate congenital cardiac malformations.
