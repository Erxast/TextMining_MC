Abstract : Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of hereditary metabolic diseases characterized by abnormal glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Often, multisystem disorders with central nervous system involvement and a large variety of clinical symptoms occur. The main characteristics are developmental delay, seizures, and ataxia. In this paper we report the clinical and biochemical characteristics of a 5-year-old girl with a defective galactosylation of N-glycans, resulting in developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, epileptic seizures, inverted nipples, and visual impairment. Next generation sequencing revealed a de novo mutation (c.797G > T, p.G266V) in the X-chromosomal gene SLC35A2 (solute carrier family 35, UDP-galactose transporter, member A2; MIM 300896). While this mutation was found heterozygous, random X-inactivation of the normal allele will lead to loss of normal SLC35A2 activity in respective cells. The functional relevance of the mutation was demonstrated by complementation of UGT-deficient MDCK-RCA(r) and CHO-Lec8 cells by normal UGT-expression construct but not by the mutant version. The effect of dietary galactose supplementation on glycosylation was investigated, showing a nearly complete normalization of transferrin glycosylation.
