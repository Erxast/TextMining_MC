Abstract : Active reabsorption of magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup> ) in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the kidney is crucial for maintaining Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Impaired activity of the Na<sup>+</sup> -Cl<sup>-</sup> -cotransporter (NCC) has been associated with hypermagnesiuria and hypomagnesemia, while increased activity of NCC, as observed in patients with Gordon syndrome, is not associated with alterations in Mg<sup>2+</sup> balance. To further elucidate the possible interrelationship between NCC activity and renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> handling, plasma Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels and urinary excretion of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup> ) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were measured in a mouse model of Gordon syndrome. In this model, DCT1-specific expression of a constitutively active mutant form of the NCC-phosphorylating kinase, SPAK (CA-SPAK), increases NCC activity and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption. These mice were normomagnesemic and HCTZ administration comparably reduced plasma Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels in CA-SPAK mice and control littermates. As inferred by the initial response to HCTZ, CA-SPAK mice exhibited greater NCC-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption together with decreased Mg<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption, compared to controls. Following prolonged HCTZ administration (4Â days), CA-SPAK mice exhibited higher urinary Mg<sup>2+</sup> excretion, while urinary Na<sup>+</sup> excretion decreased to levels observed in control animals. Surprisingly, CA-SPAK mice had unaltered renal expression of Trpm6, encoding the Mg<sup>2+</sup> -permeable channel TRPM6, or other magnesiotropic genes. In conclusion, CA-SPAK mice exhibit normomagnesemia, despite increased NCC activity and Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption. Thus, Mg<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption is not coupled to increased thiazide-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption, suggesting a similar process explains normomagnesemia in Gordon syndrome. Further research is required to unravel the molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon and the more pronounced Mg<sup>2+</sup> excretion after prolonged HCTZ administration.
