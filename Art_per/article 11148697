Date : 2000
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Neuro-ophthalmology is a difficult and challenging field for ophthalmologists, orthoptists, and neurologists. Unfortunately, signs and symptoms of these patients can be very subtle and easily overlooked. Although neuro-ophthalmologic cases are rare in the practice of a general ophthalmologist, missing the diagnosis can have severe impact on the patient's health. The authors review last year's publications of neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of systemic and neurologic disease.
