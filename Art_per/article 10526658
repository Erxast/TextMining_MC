Abstract : We report clinical, genetical and genealogical findings in 149 French families from the Rh√¥ne-Alpes area studied over a 5-year period. There was a significant excess of DM females compared to DM males with (CTG) repeat sizes between 1-2 kb. The mean maternal (CTG) repeat size was higher than paternal repeat size. Anticipation phenomenom was significantly higher after maternal than after paternal transmission. A significant correlation between parental (CTG) repeat size and intergenerational variation both in paternal and maternal transmissions was observed. The anticipation phenomenom was more important for sons than daughters particularly after maternal transmission. The mean (CTG) repeat size in mothers of CDM cases was about twice that of mothers of NCDM children. The risk of giving birth to a CDM child increased considerably when the number of maternal (CTG) repeats was over 300 (CTG). A significant excess of DM females was observed. They had on average 24% fewer children than male patients. Paternal transmission (63.6%) of DM occurred more frequently than maternal transmission (52.7%).
