Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : This is a case of congenital fiber-type disproportion that presented prenatally with bilateral clubfoot, hydramnios, and reduced fetal movements. Although prognosis is generally good for this condition, the neonate presenting at birth may have a more severe form of congenital fiber-type disproportion with a high rate of mortality.
