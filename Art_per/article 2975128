Title : [Congenital stenosis of the mid ureter].
Date : 1988
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital strictures of the mid ureter of the left side are very rare entities. One case, recently diagnosed and treated, causing hydroureteronephrosis of the upper tract is herein reported. Few similar cases have been recorded in literature reviews: infact, on the right side, or in more cranial or caudal portions, a ureteral narrowing can be found more frequently and often due to aberrant vessels, underlying once more the actual rarity of this entity on the left side. In the present case of congenital stricture of the mid left ureter no extrinsic causes of narrowing were found at operation, confirming the presence of a topic and segmentary anomaly of the muscular portion of the ureteral wall. Surgical treatment led to complete recovery.
