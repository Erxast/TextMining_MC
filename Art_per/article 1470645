Abstract : The authors consider the Extent of the several anatomical structures which constitute the deep venous network, and the part they can take in the case of deep venous insufficiency. Congenital Vascular diseases are called back in mind when considering Embryology, and point out the extent of the deep venous state; such veins can gather in periarterial plexus, at the muscular Level, and in going past all along main arterial axes. Among all the critical points of these axes, we must keep the popliteal veins, the femoral crossing, and the iliocaval one and elsewhere, the important question of venous valves and communicating and perforating veins. The part of the lymphatic network must be pointed out, because of its extent in the stasis phenomenons.
