Abstract : To identify areas of difficulty encountered by a regional wheelchair service in providing Electric Powered Indoor/outdoor wheelchairs (EPIOCs) to those with muscular dystrophy (MD) in the early years of their provision--particularly posture, pain and deformity.Wheelchair service records of all users between April 1997 and March 2000 were reviewed retrospectively and issues relating to weakness, pain/discomfort, deformities, other medical issues, weight change, function, posture and driving were documented on a purpose-designed proforma. Adjustments and modifications were documented over the 2-year period following chair delivery.Of 325 EPIOC users on the departmental database, 29 had MD (15 Duchenne's), whose users charts were reviewed. Almost 80% of users needed clinical review within 2 years, mostly due to a scoliosis. Other problems were postural (66%), medical (48%), pain (31%), functional (24%) and weight change (14%). The commonest prescriptions were for specialised seating (24%), lateral supports, headrests and footrests (21% each).The rate of disease progression was not planned for by the service. Most clients were seen in response to deterioration, rather than anticipating it. Planned reviews within 1 year appear essential for teenagers with MD with the dual issues of rapid maturation and progressive disease.
