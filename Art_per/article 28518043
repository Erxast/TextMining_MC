Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In 2015 and 2016, we observed 15 malformed calves that were exposed to intrauterine infection with Shamonda virus, a Simbu serogroup orthobunyavirus, in Japan. Characteristic manifestations were arthrogryposis and gross lesions in the central nervous system. Our results indicate that this arbovirus should be considered a teratogenic virus in ruminants.
