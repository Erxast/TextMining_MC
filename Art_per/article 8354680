Abstract : Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare connective-tissue disorder characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes and by progressive heterotopic ossification of the tendons, ligaments, fasciae, and skeletal muscles. We document the genetic transmission of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva from a sporadically affected father to each of his three children: two daughters and a son. Previous consideration of a genetic etiology was based on the fact that the disease has been reported in several sets of monozygotic twins, that an increased paternal age has been associated with sporadic occurrences of the disorder, and that there have been several reports of genetic transmission in the remote past. Although an autosomal-dominant genetic transmission has long been suspected, the findings in the family reported on here provide confirmation for such inheritance and a basis for the diagnosis and counseling of patients who have this disease.
