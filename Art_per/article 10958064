Abstract : The authors analyze 127 rare diaphragm diseases. Among them, the rate of true diaphragmatic hernias does not exceed 1%. The congenital through diaphragm defects were encountered three times more often than false hernias, equally frequently on the left and on the right. The majority of the patients (51.97%) had hernia of Larrey's fissure. The rate of true hernia (Morgagni's) was 3 times less than of false hernia (Larrey's). In Bochdalek's hernia (3.15%) false hernias were found three times more often than true hernias. Relaxation of diaphragm was found in 40.94% of the patients. Right-sided complete diaphragm's relaxation occurred 4 times less often than on the left, partial--10 times more often on the right than on the left. Duplication of diaphragm with inserting kapron net, velours or teflon between it layers remains the dominant way of surgical correction of total relaxation of diaphragm's cupula.
