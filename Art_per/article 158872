Abstract : 150 cases of chronic inflammatory lung diseases of unknown aetiology and assumed hyperergic (immuno-reactive) pathogenesis were examined for hypertensive pulmonary arterial lesions and for chronic cor pulmonale. Hypertensive lesions of the small pulmonary arteries were found in more than half of the cases with chronic disorders of long duration, but were inconspicuous in diseases of acute progressive character. Hypertensive lesions were found regularly in chronic interstitial pneumonia, frequently in scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis and occasionally in dermatomyositis and disseminated lupus erythematosus. Chronic Cor pulmonale occurred in 16% of the cases with hypertensive arterial lesions of grade I (hypertrophy of media) and in 50% of grade II/III (hypertrophy of media and intimal fibrosis). Interstitial lung fibrosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cor pulmonale: two thirds of the cases with interstitial lung fibrosis had developed cor pulmonale and all the cases with cor pulmonale also had interstitial lung fibrosis. Hypertensive arterial lesions of grade IV-VI according to Heath and Edwards (angiitis, plexogenic and angiomatoid lesions) have been described in severe cases of pulmonary hypertension (congenital cardiac shunts, primary pulmonary hypertension). In secondary forms of pulmonary hypertension, as represented by our material, these changes are of little importance.
