Date : 1996
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a case of bifocal recurrent lesion developed in muscles of the left thigh in a 5 year-old-girl with Proteus syndrome (rare congenital hamartomatous disorder). We discuss the diagnosis of focal myositis versus hamartoma. The clinical and morphological features favour the second hypothesis.
