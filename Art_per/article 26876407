Abstract : Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by postnatal progressive heterotopic ossification of connective tissue and congenital malformation of big toes. We report a 3-year male toddler with clinical and radiological features of FOP. He was born with bilateral hallux valgus and at the age of 3 years presented with hard swellings over back, scapular region and forehead that were initially inflammatory and then became bony hard. There is also tilting of neck towards the left due to calcification in neck region. The radiographs showed heterotopic ossification in thoracic region, neck, spine and region of hip joint.
