Abstract : Electron spin resonance experiments have been performed on erythrocyte membranes from rats with myotonia induced by treatment with 20,25-diazacholesterol. The results suggest that erythrocyte membranes in this animal model of human congenital myotonia possess a highly significantly increased surface membrane fluidity compared to that of controls. Alterations in the physical state of membrane proteins were not apparent. These findings, also present in human congenital myotonia [Butterfield, Chesnut, Roses & Appel, 1976, Nature (London) 263:159; Butterfield, 1977 (Submitted for publication)], strengthen the concepts that increased membrane fluidity is associated with the presence of myotonia and that congenital myotonia may be a diffuse membrane disease.
