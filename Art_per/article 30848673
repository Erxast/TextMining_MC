Abstract : The aim of the study was to assess predictors of outcome in patients hospitalized for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and severe left ventricular dysfunction. PatientsÂ & methods: 83 pediatric patients hospitalized for heart failure due to DCM with coexistent left ventricular dysfunction were enrolled.Overall, 5-year survival free from heart transplantation was 69.8%. Normalization of left ventricular function was achieved in 39.8% of patients during follow-up: younger age, less necessity of inotropic support and other than idiopathic DCM predicted left ventricular function, while familial history for cardiac disease or sudden death and inotropic support during hospitalization were associated with poorer outcome.Almost 40% of patients with DCM experienced a complete normalization of cardiac function. Outcome was extremely variable according to the type of DCM.
