Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Forty-five cases of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita were reviewed with respect to deformities and function of the hand. A distal predominance of the involvement and severity was apparent; hand deformity was a common manifestation in the arthrogrypotic patients. The majority of the hand deformities consisted of two types: one was a thumb-in-palm deformity with the fingers in intrinsic plus position, and another type was flexion contractures of the fingers at the interphalangeal joints. Regardless of type, hand function was impaired with severe or moderate deformity. Twenty-nine hands of 17 patients were successfully treated by surgery. Surgical methods are discussed based on an analysis of hand deformity and function.
