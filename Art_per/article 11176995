Abstract : A newborn male was noted to have bilateral congenital corneal opacification. Findings from examination disclosed a variety of dysmorphic features, including cutis laxa, progeroid aspect, short stature, multiple hyperextensible subluxated joints, muscular hypotonia, and hyperreflexia. Bilateral penetrating keratoplasties were performed; histopathologic examination revealed diffuse epithelial thickening, loss of the Bowman layer, and stromal attenuation with anterior stromal scarring. Special stains showed no deposition of abnormal material in the corneas. Electron microscopy demonstrated absence of Bowman layer differentiation with a paucity of collagen fibers, as well as extensive small elastic fibers in the anterior stroma. The diagnosis of De Barsy syndrome was made, a rare progeroid syndrome associated with characteristic ocular, facial, skeletal, dermatologic, and neurologic abnormalities. De Barsy syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of congenital corneal opacification; its distinctive clinical features enable the clinician to easily differentiate it from other causes of congenitally cloudy corneas.
