Abstract : The wind-blown hand is part of a complex congenital malformation syndrome. In addition to malformations in the head and feet, the hands are deformed in a characteristic manner. The metacarpophalangeal joints are bilaterally in flexion contracture and ulnar deviation. The thumb is adducted (thumb-in-palm deformity), flexed in the metacarpophalangeal joint and hyperextended in the interphalangeal joint. The etiology of this rare congenital syndrome is relatively unknown, although some hypotheses are discussed. Conservative therapeutic procedures include early splinting, but results are often disappointing. Early performed operations may improve hand function.
