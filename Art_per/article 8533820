Title : Geleophysic dysplasia: a report of three affected boys--prenatal ultrasound does not detect recurrence.
Date : 1995
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Geleophysic dysplasia is characterized by short stature with short limbs and brachydactyly, a "happy" facial appearance, and joint contractures. Infiltration of heart valves and liver with a mucopolysaccharide-like substance has been demonstrated in some patients. A metabolic pathogenesis is suspected, but has not yet been identified. We report on 3 boys with the condition, 2 of whom are brothers. Serial ultrasound scans were performed on 2 of the cases during pregnancy, but short limbs did not become obvious until after 28 weeks of gestation, making it an uninformative procedure for prenatal diagnosis.
