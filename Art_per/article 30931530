Abstract : The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are inborn errors of metabolism with a great genetic heterogeneity. Most CDG are caused by defects in the N-glycan biosynthesis, leading to multisystem phenotypes. However, the occurrence of tissue-restricted clinical symptoms in the various defects in dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthesis remains unexplained. To deepen our understanding of the tissue-specific characteristics of defects in the DPM synthesis pathway, we investigated N-glycosylation and O-mannosylation in skeletal muscle of three DPM3-CDG patients presenting with muscle dystrophy and hypo-N-glycosylation of serum transferrin in only two of them. In the three patients, O-mannosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (αDG) was strongly reduced and western blot analysis of beta-dystroglycan (βDG) N-glycosylation revealed a consistent lack of one N-glycan in skeletal muscle. Recently, defective N-glycosylation of βDG has been reported in patients with mutations in guanosine-diphosphate-mannose pyrophosphorylase B (GMPPB). Thus, we suggest that aberrant O-glycosylation of αDG and N-glycosylation of βDG in skeletal muscle is indicative of a defect in the DPM synthesis pathway. Further studies should address to what extent hypo-N-glycosylation of βDG or other skeletal muscle proteins contribute to the phenotype of patients with defects in DPM synthesis. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the tissue-restricted phenotype of DPM3-CDG and other defects in the DPM synthesis pathway.
