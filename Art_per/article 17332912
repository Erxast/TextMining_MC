Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in Taiwan has increased in recent decades. Extrapulmonary infection accounts for 40% of all tuberculosis cases. Here we report a seven-year-old girl with culture-proven tuberculous myositis manifested as progressive enlargement of chest wall mass. No congenital or acquired immune deficiency could be traced at presentation. After surgical excision and completion of 6-month anti-tuberculous therapy, no recurrence of mass or any sequela was found during 6 months of follow-up.
