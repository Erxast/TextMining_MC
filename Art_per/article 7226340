Abstract : The Authors describe a bilateral congenital case of flexion and valgism of the IF of the hallux, since they are not mentioned in literature. On the basis of the operative examination it is thought that the etiopathogenesis may consist of a congenital retraction of the capsule, in plantar aspect, and of the collateral ligaments; they advise that surgical treatment should be carried out before the start of ambulation. The correction obtained proved stable over time.
