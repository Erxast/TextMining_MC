Title : Respiratory deterioration during growth hormone therapy in a case of congenital nemaline myopathy.
Date : 1990
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : Congenital nemaline myopathy (CNM) is generally classified as a non-progressive or slowly progressive neuromuscular disease. We describe a boy with CNM and an isolated partial growth hormone (GH) deficiency. From the onset of GH therapy his respiratory capacity deteriorated rapidly. The possible association between this deterioration and GH therapy is discussed.
