Abstract : The light and electron microscopic myopathologic and dermatopathologic features in one patient with the partial (localized) type of lipodystrophy are described. The myopathologic changes involve both the contractile elements and the intracellular organelles, especially mitochondria that show hyperplasia and structural alterations of cristae. The dermatopathologic changes consist of a reduction in subcutaneous fat, intercellular edema, and the presence of intracytoplasmic lipid droplets. This is the first report in the literature in which the myopathologic features and detailed electron microscopy of skin in this condition are described. The myopathologic features of partial lipodystrophy are compared with those of congenital generalized lipodystrophy. It is proposed that a myopathy may be one of the manifestations of partial lipodystrophy.
