Abstract : Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), and muscle-eye-brain (MEB) disease are clinically similar autosomal recessive disorders characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, lissencephaly, and eye anomalies. Through positional cloning, we identified the gene for FCMD and MEB, which encodes the fukutin protein and the protein O-linked mannose beta1, 2-N-acetylglucosaminy ltransferase (POMGnT1), respectively. Recent studies have revealed that posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan is associated with these congenital muscular dystrophies with brain malformations. In this review Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), other CMDs with brain malformations, and their relation with alpha-dystroglycan are discussed.
