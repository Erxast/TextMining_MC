Abstract : To analyze the contribution of prenatal ultrasound in the diagnosis of arthrogryposis multiplex congenital according to its type and antenatal expression.Retrospective study led between January 1993 and November 2007. We studied the cases of arthrogryposis suspected or diagnosed by antenatal ultrasound while analyzing the circumstances of discovery, the profile of the pregnant women and the abnormal scan findings.16 observations have been collected. We recovered one multiple pterigium syndrome and five observations of severe fetal akinesia sequences diagnosed in the second trimester. The arthrogryposis was part of different syndromes in other cases. Four distal arthrogryposis had been diagnosed in the second trimester. All cases suspected during the third trimester were associated to an anomaly of the amniotic fluid, mainly to a polyhydramnios. The abnormal scan findings were less specific to this term.Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital is rare. It has several morphological aspects. Some ultrasound aspects are specific in the first and second trimesters. The diagnosis is more difficult at the third trimester.
