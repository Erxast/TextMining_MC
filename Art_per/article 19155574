Abstract : We describe an infant with nemaline myopathy accompanied by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The patient required long-term, intermittent positive-pressure ventilation after birth owing to muscle weakness, and cardiac failure developed during infancy. We diagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction, and treated the heart failure with beta-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor blockers. We discuss the prognosis of nemaline myopathy combined with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
