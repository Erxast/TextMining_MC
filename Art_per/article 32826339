Abstract : Disorders of central and peripheral nervous system should be considered in floppy infants with ventilator dependence. Workup for neuromuscular disorders should be undertaken in infants with hypotonia, weakness, contractures, feeding difficulties, or failed attempts at extubation. We present the case of a preterm infant with hypotonia and ventilator dependence where despite a positive result, further investigations were undertaken because of lack of clinical correlation. The infant had a rare combination of 2 neuromuscular conditions: X-linked myotubular myopathy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One was the reason for immediate clinical manifestation and the other influenced the prognosis and decision-making in determining reorientation of care. This case demonstrates the value of interpretation of a positive result that did not explain the clinical picture and warranted consideration of further diagnosis. This case also emphasizes the importance of discussions with family about the prognosis of 2 conditions that influenced decision making.
