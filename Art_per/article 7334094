Abstract : Thirty-six patients with arthrogryposis have been followed at The James Lawrence Kernan Hospital of Baltimore since 1951. In this group, nine patients sustained 16 perinatal fractures. Femoral shaft fractures and epiphyseal separations were found more commonly in patients with fixed knee extension or dislocated hips and were related to relative stiffness and obstructed delivery. Femoral fractures were more common than humeral or tibial fractures. Arthrogrypotic infants displaying irritability and poor feeding are suspect of skeletal trauma. Thickening of limbs or joints may be the only clinical indication of fracture of epiphyseal injury. Plain radiographs of joints were inadequate for the diagnosis of epiphyseal separation when the epiphysis was not yet ossified. Arthrography is therefore recommended as a primary diagnostic tool.
