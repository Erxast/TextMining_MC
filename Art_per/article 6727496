Abstract : The endoscopic application of electrodes for electromyography of laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles is routinely performed in adults and very helpful in electrodiagnosis of voice and speech disturbances. Dysfunctions of the lower cranial nerves in infancy and childhood are congenital diseases in most of the cases. Up to now the most helpful diagnostic tool has been direct laryngoscopy which, however, could not classify the type of peripheral or central neural or even muscular disease. It is only by electrophysiological methods that the laryngologist can answer these questions. Electromyography and neuromyography as well as reflex myography of the lower cranial nerves have been performed in ten children since 1979, enabling diagnosis and classification of congenital and acquired lesions in the muscles of tongue, soft palate, pharynx and larynx. In particular accurate diagnosis of laryngeal malacia with intact peripheral innervation and voluntary activity during electromyography is always possible. In addition, the method is helpful in the planning of therapy which consists in either conservative or surgical treatment.
