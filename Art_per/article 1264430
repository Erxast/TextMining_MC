Date : 1976
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : A list of syndromes that include foot deformities as part of the clinical presentation has been compiled and subdivided into a descriptive classification. A brief discussion is presented of the embryology of the foot as it pertains to and helps explain the etiology of these various anomalies. Variations in the treatment of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and ring constrictions are described. Finally, unique foot configurations are documented, which if seen should alert the clinician to consider the diagnosis of a specific syndrome.
