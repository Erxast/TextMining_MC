Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : We report a case of congenital infiltrating lipomatosis of the face (CILF) with right TMJ ankylosis causing asymmetry and reduced mouth opening. The management involved soft tissue debulking combined with a right TMJ arthroplasty and is explained in detail. A review of the relevant literature revealed the rarity of this condition. The diagnosis of CILF remains challenging. The currently accepted treatment strategy is less aggressive as facial asymmetry tends to recur. Infiltration of the facial structures from adipose tissue requires several surgical procedures in most cases. Bony hypertrophy on the affected side has been a common finding in reported cases. There have been no previous reports of TMJ ankylosis associated with this condition. CILF is a benign condition with a good long term prognosis. After 2 years of follow up our patient, has maintained full function despite facial asymmetry.
