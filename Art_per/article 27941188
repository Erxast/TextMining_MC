Abstract : Arthrogryposis multiplex congenital (AMC) is a heterogeneous disorder, characterized by nonprogressive multiple intra-articular contractures, which can be recognized at birth. The prevalence in Europe is estimated at about 1 per 12,000. Etiopathogenesis of arthrogryposis is multifactorial. Symptoms of some forms of arthrogryposis can be found in the clinical presentation of selected genetic disorders, e.g. Pena Shokeir syndrome. Arthrogryposis can also result from environmental factors such as medication, trauma or chronic illness during pregnancy, as well as from oligohydramnios or abnormal structure of the uterus. In this particular disorder prenatal diagnosis is crucial, because it determines the level of hospital reference during the delivery of the affected child. The highest reference degree hospital is preferential, with staff prepared for the multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of the newborn. The key to success is rehabilitation treatment and it should be initiated as soon as possible. In a substantial number of cases, physical therapy can replace invasive corrective surgery, but even when orthopedic treatment is required, it should always be preceded and followed by rehabilitation.
