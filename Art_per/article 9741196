Abstract : Rhabdomyolysis is a condition affecting body homeostasis that results from impaired supply of muscles with energy, nutritional factors and blood. Complex pathophysiological mechanism causes that extended myolysis may complicate different clinical conditions, such as: crush syndrome, excessive physical effort (work, seizures), toxic effect of drugs and toxins, water-electrolyte disturbances, congenital enzymatic deficiencies etc. It seems that on the cellular level, essential role is played by excessively high intracytoplasmatic calcium level, which affects metabolic processes. So high calcium level is a consequence of muscular cell injury irrespective to its reason. It manifests clinically as muscular weakness, pal and oedema and laboratory tests reveal elevated CK, GOT, GPT, aldolase and LDH levels as well as dark brown urine colour. Demonstration of elevated serum myoglobin level or its presence in urine directly confirms development of rhabdomyolysis. In unfavorable conditions, rhabdomyolysis may result in acute renal failure. Appropriately early and adequate water supply and alkalization plays an essential role in prevention of impairment in renal function. In advanced phase of renal failure, hemodialysis is a standard treatment.
