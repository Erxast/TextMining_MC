Abstract : We examined 22 biopsied muscles from adult patients who had the histopathological characteristics of nemaline myopathy. In the first group, 13 patients had muscle weakness and/or skeletal abnormalities, such as high-arched palate, pes cavus and scoliosis which are often accompanied with the congenital nemaline myopathy. Their appropriate diagnosis had never been made until muscle biopsy was done, because of benign clinical course. In the second group, the symptoms of nine patients became manifest in adulthood and failed to show typical skeletal abnormalities. However, six muscle biopsies showed the histopathologic characteristics of congenital nemaline myopathy; abnormal fiber type distribution including type 1 fiber predominancy, type 1 fiber atrophy and type 2B fiber deficiency. Three patients remained in good health until adulthood when they developed muscle weakness with pathologic findings of nemaline myopathy. Accordingly, nemaline myopathy in adulthood can be categorized into three forms; the first two forms have clinical and pathologic evidence of the congenital benign form, whereas the symptoms are too mild to be noticed. The third form is not a hereditary disorder which may result from autoimmune pathophysiology.
