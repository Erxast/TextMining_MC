Abstract : The Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS) is a rare congenital myopathy and dysplasia. The musculoskeletal and soft-tissue manifestations of FSS often require orthopedic and plastic reconstructive surgery. We report a case of a 7-year-old girl with FSS operated for lower limb malformation during spinal anesthesia.
