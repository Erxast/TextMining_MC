Abstract : Central core disease is a congenital myopathy caused by mutations in RYR1. A 6-year-old girl was admitted due to difficulty in running and climbing stairs. Another 13 members through the four generations had similar symptoms, indicating autosomal dominant inheritance. Muscle biopsy showed the characteristic central cores in predominant type 1 fibers. She later developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Mutation analysis identified c.14582G>A in RYR1, and c.1693delG and c.2954 + 5G>A in UNC13D. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient with central core disease, carrying a RYR1 mutation in a Korean large family, who had concurrent familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
