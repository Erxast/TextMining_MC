Abstract : Cutaneous atrophic conditions are typically caused by changes in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue, sometimes consisting of the loss of a single fiber type. Since a significant decrease of subepidermal tissue is necessary for these lesions to be macroscopically atrophic, many conditions may not be appreciated as atrophy in the clinical setting. Clinicians should be familiar with the common or classic disorders causing cutaneous atrophy; however, there are a few new or rarely described atrophic conditions which are more difficult to identify and may not be atrophic clinically. This paper serves to describe the salient clinical and histological features of these new or rare disorders.
