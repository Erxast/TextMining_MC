Title : Altered Metabolic Flexibility in Inherited Metabolic Diseases of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Metabolism.

Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : In general, metabolic flexibility refers to an organism's capacity to adapt to metabolic changes due to differing energy demands. The aim of this work is to summarize and discuss recent findings regarding variables that modulate energy regulation in two different pathways of mitochondrial fatty metabolism: β-oxidation and fatty acid biosynthesis. We focus specifically on two diseases: very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) and malonyl-CoA synthetase deficiency (acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3)) deficiency, which are both characterized by alterations in metabolic flexibility. On the one hand, in a mouse model of VLCAD-deficient (VLCAD<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, the white skeletal muscle undergoes metabolic and morphologic transdifferentiation towards glycolytic muscle fiber types via the up-regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis (mtFAS). On the other hand, in ACSF3-deficient patients, fibroblasts show impaired mitochondrial respiration, reduced lipoylation, and reduced glycolytic flux, which are compensated for by an increased β-oxidation rate and the use of anaplerotic amino acids to address the energy needs. Here, we discuss a possible co-regulation by mtFAS and β-oxidation in the maintenance of energy homeostasis.
