Abstract : To study the characteristics, if any, of unstable CTG repeat sequence in Japanese myotonic dystrophy (DM), we analyzed DNA from 351 at risk individuals (including affected and non-affected carriers and their descendants) from 105 families in Japan. A total of 93 DM families (196 affected and 116 unaffected individuals), including 84 DM parent-child pairs (44 father-child and 40 mother-child pairs), were examined, many of which had been previously tested by linkage analysis. We detected unstable CTG repeat mutations between 0.15 kb and 8.7 kb in size. The size of the mutation correlated with the age of onset of symptoms. There was a significant difference in DM allele size among the four groups (congenital, juvenile onset, classical, and minimal). Congenital DM had on average the largest repeat sizes. Comparison of parent-child pairs showed that most offspring had a larger repeat size than their parents, with only 2 of 84 showing a definite decrease in repeat size. The correlation coefficients for maternal and paternal transmission were 0.41 and 0.15, respectively. The parental age (maternal and paternal) did not correlate with intergenerational change of repeat. These observations are similar to those reported in Caucasians.
