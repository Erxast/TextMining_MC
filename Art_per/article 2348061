Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The windblown hand deformity, also known as congenital ulnar drift of the fingers and congenital contractures of the digits is reported infrequently in the literature. Although the syndrome is well described, authors' use of different terms is confusing. In more than 20 years of practice, we have observed 11 patients with the windblown hand and have operated on 7 hands in 4 patients. The anomaly appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and may represent a variation of some type of arthrogryposis. Ulnar drift of the digits is often present at birth and becomes more pronounced as the child grows. The one factor common to all case reports is a flexion contracture of the metacarpophalangeal joints, with ulnar deviation of the fingers. Also, the thumb is webbed to the palm by a soft tissue bridge. Most cases of the windblown hand should be treated within the first 2 years of life. Because the windblown hand has many variations, each patient must be treated individually. We report a series on the windblown hand and propose a treatment plan for this rare anomaly.
