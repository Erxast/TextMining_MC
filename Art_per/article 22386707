Abstract : The ease of sniff nasal inspiratory pressure testing may extend application of respiratory muscle assessment to younger and cognitively-impaired children. We sought to quantify sniff nasal inspiratory pressure in childhood neuromuscular disorders, and to correlate this measure with conventional pulmonary function tests and overnight polysomnography. Thirty children (mean 9.7 ± 3.8 years, range 4.3-16.5 years) with diagnosed neuromuscular disorders (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, congenital myopathy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, multi-minicore disease) underwent assessment. Thirty-seven percent displayed cognitive impairment. Those with neuromuscular disorders were then compared with 32 volunteer age- and gender-matched controls (mean 10.9 ± 2.9 years, range 6.6-17.2 years) with normal respiratory function. Twenty-three children with neuromuscular disorders also underwent overnight polysomnography. Children with neuromuscular disorders demonstrated significantly impaired sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, maximal inspiratory pressure, FEV(1) and FVC (p<0.05). A positive correlation was identified between daytime sniff nasal inspiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory pressure (r=0.58), FEV(1) (r=0.55) and FVC (r=0.46), though not with polysomnography variables (respiratory disturbance index, nadir SpO(2), peak CO(2)). Moderate prevalence of nocturnal hypoxia was observed, and 32% of children demonstrated sleep disordered breathing. Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure assessment was well tolerated, representing a promising surrogate measure for assessment of respiratory function in childhood neuromuscular disorders.
