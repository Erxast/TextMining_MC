Abstract : Mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) cause different muscle disorders. The specific molecular pathobiological processes that cause these different phenotypes remains unexplained. We describe three members of a family with an autosomal dominant mutation in the distal rod of MYH7 [c.5401G> A (p.Glu1801Lys)] displaying a complex phenotype characterized by Laing Distal Myopathy like phenotype, left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and Fiber Type Disproportion picture at muscle biopsy. We suggest that this overlapping presentation confirm the phenotypic variability of MYH7 myopathy and may be helpful to improve the genotype phenotype correlation.
