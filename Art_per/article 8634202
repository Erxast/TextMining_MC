Title : Centronuclear myopathy and nursing pattern caries: management of a 1 year old.
Date : 1995
Publication_type : Journal Article
Abstract : The pathognomonic open mouth of centronuclear and other myopathies can also have implications for oral health. These patients are at greater risk for gingivitis, dental caries as a result of the mouth breathing and loss of lip seal. Low tongue posture may impede the lateral expansion of the maxilla resulting in a constricted maxillary arch with resultant posterior crossbites and functional shifts. Excessive molar eruption may also occur, resulting in anterior open bites and increases in the anterior lower vertical height.
