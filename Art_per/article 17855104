Abstract : Treatment of facial paralysis by muscular neurotization resulted in ectopic ossification in 1 of 134 cases in this department. That patient suffering from Moebius syndrome (MS) is presented. Reviewing the literature concerning MS, Hox genes and bone morphogenetic protein dysregulation, a pathogenesis of ossification in MS is suggested.The MS patient exhibited a congenital facial nerve palsy, which was treated by muscular neurotization (Lexer-Rosenthal). Because of postoperative ossification of scarred areas, osteotomy of the processus muscularis and mobilization of the masseter muscle was performed. Nevertheless, further ossification occurred at the interface between the mandible and zygoma and in two masticatory muscles. So, the construction of a neoarthrosis became necessary. Three years later, the iatrogenic bone defect had reossified despite of an active opening therapy.Ectopic ossification after muscular neurotization seems to be restricted to patients with MS and is triggered by trauma. Molecular pathogenesis: facial malformations in MS are caused by disturbances in embryonic patterning. Failure in the development of the second pharyngeal arch leads to a spatial BMP-4 dysregulation responsible for ossification after wounding of muscle fascia. Therefore, surgical rehabilitation of facial function by muscular neurotization is contra indicated in MS patients.
